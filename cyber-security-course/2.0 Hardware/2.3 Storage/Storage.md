- SSDs
	- Wear Levelling
		- Every time data is written to an SSD, it will distribute the write across its various sectors to prevent one sector/segment from wearing out too much compared to others - it keeps a balance. 
		- This is because all SSDs have a lifetime to the writes that are possible per sector - once this lifetime/cap is hit, it will no longer be able to support any more writes
