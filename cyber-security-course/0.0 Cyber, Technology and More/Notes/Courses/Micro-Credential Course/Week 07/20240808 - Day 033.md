LINUX
- Reporting all errors that are thrown into Dev Null
- /dev/
	- Container/folder that contains virtual devices
	- contains stderr, stdin, and stdout
		- These can be redirected to other places if needs be
		- /dev/stderr
			- Will display on the screen
		- /dev/stdin
			- Keyboard input
			- normally linked out to another location/file
				- ie /proc/self/fd/0
					- 
		- /dev/stdout
			- Will display on the screen or wherever the default link is pointing to in dev/stderr
			- 2 > stderr
	- /dev/random
		- Fake device which generates random data (REAL FAST)
	- /dev/zero
		- Even faster than random...
	- /dev/mem
	- /dev/mapper
		- 
	- /dev/null
		- Trashcan
- /proc/ 
	A virtual directory that contains information around the various processes that are running on the computer

	- processes
	- cpuinfo
	- vmstat
	- meminfo

	- pid folders
		- File Descriptor
			- (will need to look this up further with references)
			- Will have content within it that will tell you information about the program 
- /etc/systemd/system
	- Units
		- Description of the service
		- Any dependencies that it has
		- systemd is a text file that describes how to run a service in Linux
- /run/
	- 
- Commands:
	- ps aux

Hardware:
- CPUs
	- L1,2,3 CPU Caches
		- L1
			- Smaller
		- L2
			- Bit further away from the CPU
			- Bigger than L1
		- L3
			- Further away again
			- Bigger than the others
	- Bugs
		- cpu_meltdown
		- spectre_v1,v2
			- look into this further
	- Enclaves
		- Working with d/encryption 
		- Fully Homomorphic Encryption

- LMStudio
	- Open Hermes
	- Llama
	- Llama CPP

Terminologies:
- RDRAND
- DUALEC DRBG
- Entropy (remember?)
	- Randomness
- SSDs
	- Wear levelling
		- Everytime you write to an SSD it will distribute the write across the various sectors (check this term because it's probably something else), to prevent one sector/segment from wearing out too much compared to others
		- All SSDs have a lifetime of writes, wherein they will not be able to write anymore
- Photocopy Machines
	- Have a drive inside of them
		- Think about the shred that happens on those for Forensic Investigations (could be stuff in there)

- Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
	- an innovative technology that can help you achieve zero trust by unlocking the value of data on untrusted domains without needing to decrypt it
		- https://www.ibm.com/topics/homomorphic-encryption#:~:text=Fully%20homomorphic%20encryption%20(FHE)%20is,various%20security%20and%20privacy%20risks.
- EBPF
	- eXtended Berkley Protocol Framework
		- Linux kernel technology that allows for dynamic and efficient tracing of various system events, such as network packets, function calls, and other system events
- Electron App
	- (with Javascript)
- Quantization 
	- The process of mapping input values from a large set to output values in a smaller set, often with a finite number of elements.
	- Rounding and truncation are typical examples of quantization process
	- qBits

TODO:
- As always, go through the above and also prior notes made
- Look at the /dev/ contents
	- Get used to what each of these do

- Free diving
	- Shallow water blackout
	- Hyperventilating to rid of CO2 levels
- Check out the rdrand backdoor
