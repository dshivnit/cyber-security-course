- Practice and study of writing and solving codes to hide the true meaning of the information
- Encryption - the process of converting ordinary information (plaintext) into an unintelligible form (ciphertext)
- Encryption is to provide protection in:
	- Data at rest
	- Data in transit
		- Data that moves across the network, sits inside RAM, or moves to and from the CPU
	- Data in use
		- Data that is undergoing a current constant state of change
- Cipher - An algorithm that performs the encryption or decryption
- Encryption strength comes from the key, not the algorithm
- Encryption algorithms are open, meaning that the mathematical equations that take place are privy to the public
	- Again, it is the key that is generated that forms the strength of each encryption algorithm
- Key - essential piece of information that determines the output of a cipher
- User larger key lengths, and rotate the keys frequently 
- The length of a key is proportional to the level of security it provides
- Regularly changing cryptographic keys is a best practice
- Most encryption algorithms are open-source and publicly accessible
- Protect the keys!
	- Store in secure hardware modules
	- Encrypt keys when at rest
	- Transmit keys securely when used
- Limit key access to regular audits and monitoring

- Steganography
	- The practice of hiding secret data within ordinary, non-secret files or messages to avoid detection 
- Tokenization
	- Substitutes sensitive data elements with non-sensitive equivalents called tokens
- Data Masking / Data Obfuscation
	- Process of disguising original data to protect sensitive information while its maintaining its authenticity and usability 

- Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption
	- Symmetric Encryption
		- Single Key
		- Symmetric Algorithm (Private Key)
			- Encryption algorithm in which both the sender and the receiver must know the same shared secret using a privately held key
		- Shared secret key
		- Can't be assured of non-repudiation
			- Multiple handlers of the same private key
		- One main issue is the distribution of the private key
		- Tend to be a 100 to a 1000 times faster than asymmetric algorithms
	- Asymmetric Encryption
		- Two different keys
		- Asymmetric Algorithms (Public Key)
		- One key to encrypt the data, the other to decrypt the data
		- For example:
			- Diffie-Hellman
			- RSA (Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman)
			- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
		- Overcomes the challenge of having to distribute a private key (such as in symmetric algorithms) securely
	- Hybrid implementations
		- Utilises asymmetric encryption to securely transfer a private key that can then be used with symmetric encryption
	- Stream cipher
		- Utilises a keystream generator to encrypt data bit by bit (or byte by byte) using a mathematically XOR function to create the ciphertext
	- Block Cipher
		- Breaks the input into fixed-length blocks of data and performs the encryption on each block
		- Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks, typically of 64, 128, or 256 bits, rather than one bit at a time

- Symmetric Algorithms
	- Method of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data
	- DES and 3DES
		- Data Encryption Standard (DES)
			- Encryption algorithm which breaks the input into 64-bit block and uses transposition and substitution to create ciphertext using an effective key strength of only 56-bits
		- Triple DES (3DES)
			- Because of DES's weakness and its key size
			- Encryption algorithm which uses three separate symmetric keys to encrypt, decrypt, then encrypt the plaintext into ciphertext in order to increase the strength of DES
	- International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)
		- Symmetric block cipher, which uses 64-bit blocks to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext
		- Was really used a lot in the PGP suite of tools
		- DES and 3DES was not strong enough
	- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
		- Symmetric block cipher that uses 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit blocks and a matching encryption key size to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext
	- Blowfish
		- Block cipher that uses a 32-bit to 448-bit encryption key to encrypt 64-bit blocks and a variable length encryption key to encrypt plaintext into cipher text
		- Replacement for DES but not widely utilised
	- Twofish
		- Provides the ability to use 128-bit blocks in its encryption algorithm and uses 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit encryption keys
	- RC Cipher Suite
		- Created by Ron Rivest
		- A cryptographer who's created six algorithms under the name RC which stands for the Rivest Cipher
		- RC4
			- Stream cipher
			- Using a variable key size from 4-bits to 2048-bits that is used in SSL and WEP
		- RC5
			- Block cipher that uses key sizes up to 2048-bits
		- RC6
			- Based on RC5
			- Stronger version of it
	- DES and 3DES
	- IDEA
	- AES
	- Blowfish
	- Twofish
	- Rivest Ciphers (RC4, RC5, RC6)

- Asymmetric Encryption
	- Does not require a shared secret key, often referred to as public key cryptography since their key is considered to be freely and openly available to the public
	- Provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation 
	- Two different keys - one for encryption, and one for decryption
	- Digital Signature
		- A hash digest - encrypted with the senders private key
		- A hash digest of a message encrypted with the sender's private key to let the recipient know the document was created and sent by the person claiming to have sent it
		- Hash digest is sent with the original message
			- To provide non-repudiation
			- Encrypted with the senders private key
		- Encrypt the original message with the receivers public key
		- Non-repudiation, integrity (with the hash digest), confidentiality attained
	-  Diffie-Helman (DH)
		- Used to conduct key exchanges and secure key distribution over an unsecure network
		- Susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks
		- Used for the key exchange inside of creating a VPN tunnel establishment as part of IPSec
	- RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
		- Asymmetric algorithm that relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers
		- Can support key sizes between 1024 - 4096bits
	- ECC - Elliptic Curve Cryptography
		- Heavily used in mobile devices and it's based on the algebraic structure of elliptical curves over finite fields to define its keys
		- ECC with a 256-bit key is just as secure as a RSA with a 2048-bit key
		- Tablets, smartphones, and other mobile based implementation
		- Takes much less processing power
		- ECDH
			- EC Diffie-Helman
			- ECC version of the DH key-exchange protocol
		- ECDHE
			- ECDH Ephemeral
			- Uses a different key for each portion of the key establishment process inside the DH key exchange
		- ECDSA 
			- EC Digital Signature Algorithm
			- Used as a public key encryption algorithm by the US Government in their digital signatures
		- ECC is most commonly used for mobile devices and low-power computing devices
		- Less processing power required to encrypt and decrypt data
