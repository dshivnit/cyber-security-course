- SC900
- AZ500

- Doing some debugging
- Assembly-level Debugger
- - GitHub Microsoft
	- https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/
- https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning
- https://msle.learnondemand.net/
	- bicep
	- Azures DSL (Domain Specific Language) for deploying Azure resources

- Will be looking at AL (Assembly Language) debuggers
	- https://x64dbg.com/
	- Main Window for the debugger
		- Addresses on the left
		- Followed by the bytes
		- Assembly then
		- And extra comments
	- Registers (to the right)
		- General Purpose registers
			- RAX
			- RBX
			- RCX
			- RDX
			- RBP
			- RSP
			- RSI
			- RDI
			- R8
			- R9
			- 
		- RIP is important
			- Register (registry?) Instruction Pointer
				- What to run next
		- 64-bit, 32-bits (depending on the system that the program is running on)
		- CPU and registers dance together, a lot.
		- Stacks
			- Memory addresses
				- of commands run
				- are stored in the stack
			- Will be in various locations
			- push 
				- To put data on to the stack
			- pop
				- To take data off the stack
			- call
				- Calls or runs a function
			- ret
				- Returns from a function
			- add
				- will add data 
			- sub
				- Will subtract data
			- xor
				- will do an xor
			- jmp
				- Jump around in code
			- J 
				- Anything starting with j will be a jump command

Terminologies and Stuff:
- erelang 
	- Used as the backend for WhatsApp, LeagueOfLegends
	- talks from 2015 
	- Mentioning how software states are never consistent, especially amongst various platforms/systems that are accessing the same system
		- Due to straight up randomness
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MakEtXAXZoY (could be the link, TBC)
- KeePassXC Password Manager
- Argon2d encryption
	- Has been the recommendation over the last nine years for encryption (password related? -- look into this further)
- SCrypt
	- Allows you to choose how much RAM to use
- BCrypt
	- Will allow you to choose how much CPU you use? 
		- Check this
- Argon
	- Does both RAM and CPU
- Pareidolia
	- Humans and their pattern recognitions 
- Argon encryption - check it out
- Scrypt
- PBKDF2
- DSL
	- Domain Specific Language
- AZURE STUFF (and also cloud stuff in general):
	- Bicep
		- A domain-specific language that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. 
	- AZ
		- Availability Zone
		- Geographic location which has two or more DC's (Data Centres)
	- AMI
		- Azure Machine Image
	- Alerts / Notifications
		- Make sure these are set up properly for FINANCIAL related items
		- The cost per VM for example
		- Set an alert when the incoming bill is going to be over a particular threshold (ie 100 p/month and so on
	- Look into budgets / budget alerts
	- MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THIS KIND OF STUFF IN CHECK
	- RBAC
		- Role-Based Access Control
	- TAGS
		- Tag the crap (tag very well and detailed, but in a comprehensive yet simple manner) all Cloud Resources/Objects
	- 
- Compliance
	- Health Data can not be transmitted over the seas or to foreign countries (ie Aus)
- Keep a note that whatever an entity chooses to start with in the early days of a project/startup will be the basis of all future developments of said project
	- Make sure the language(s), systems used are well thought in the initial planning phases
		- Do we have the needed developers for said project in the respective region? (say for example)
	- Early decision making is critical 
- Reputation grows in drops
	- Remember that

ToDo:
- GitHub Microsoft
	- https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning
	- Do the labs on there first before the Licensed version
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/
- Argon encryption - check it out
- Scrypt
