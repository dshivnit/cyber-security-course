- Handle(s)
	- Handles are essentially tokens to access certain kernel services, when you pass a handle to another process (e.g. child process will inherit handles that are explicitly set to be inheritable), the kernel actually "duplicates" the handle and increases the handle counter of the particular resource
	- In computer programming, a handle is an abstract to a resource that is used when application software references blocks of memory or objects that are managed by another system like a database or an operating system

	- Handles in Windows represent references to system resources, such as files, registry keys, or communication channels. Processes use handles to interact with these resources. A process can open a handle to a file, enablign it to read, write, or close the file.
