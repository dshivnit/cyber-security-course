- APTs
	- Advanced Persistent Threat
	- APTs is a prolonged and targeted cyberattack from where an intruder gains unauthorised access to a network/system and remains undetected for an extended period of time
	- While trying to steal data, and to monitor activities rather than cause immediate damage

- Unskilled Attackers
	- Individuals with limited technical expertise who use readily available tools like downloaded scripts or exploits to carry out attacks
	- Skids
	- Can still cause significant damage
	- Defacing websites
	- Spreading malware
	- DDoS attacks
	- IoN cannon
- Hacktivists
	- Cyber attackers who carry out their activities driven by political, social, or environmental ideologies who often want to draw attention to a specific cause
- Organised Crime
	- Well-structured groups that execute cyberattacks for financial gain, usually through methods like ransomware, identity theft, or credit card fraud
		- Carbanak  
	- APT
- Nation-state Actors
	- Highly skilled attackers that are sponsored by governments to carry out cyber espionage, sabotage, or cyber warfare against other nation states or specific targets in a variety of industries
		- False Flag Attacks
			- Orchestrated in such a way that it seems to originate from a different source or group than from the actual perpetrators
			- Attribute the attack to someone else
	- APT
- Insider Threats
	- Security threats that originate from within the organisation

- Shadow IT
	- IT systems, devices, software, applications, and services that are managed and utilised without explicit organisational approval

- Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces
	- Message-based
	- Image-based
	- File-based
	- Voice Calls
	- Removable Devices
	- Use of Unsecured Networks

- Deception and Disruption Technologies for Defense
	- Honeypots
		- Decoy systems or servers designed to attract and deceive potential attackers, simulating real-world IT assets to study their techniques
	- Honeynets
		- Create an entire of decoy systems to observe complex, multi-stage attacks
	- Honeyfiles
		- Decoy files placed within systems to detect unauthorised access or data breaches
	- Honeytokens
		- Fake pieces of data, like credentials, inserted into databases or systems to alert administrators whenever they are accessed or used

- It is important to remember that there is a difference between the intent behind an attack and the motivation that fuels that attack

- Motivations of Threat Actors
	- - Data Exfiltration
		- The unauthorised transfer of data from a computer
		- For example, if an attacker logs into a computer and steals client contact information - they have successfully exfiltrated information that is sensitive
		- IP
		- PII
		- Trade secrets
		- Being sold on the Dark Web
		- Leveraging it for competitive advantage
		- Using it for identity theft
	- Financial Gain
		- One of the most common motivations for cybercriminals
		- Ransomware attacks
		- Banking trojans
	- Blackmail
		- The attacker obtains sensitive or compromising information about an individual or an organisation and threatens to release this information to the public unless certain demands are met
		- Normally financial transactions in encrypted currencies like Bitcoin
		- Ransomware
		- Doxxing
		- Sextortion
	- Service Disruption
		- Often achieved by conducting a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack to overwhelm a network, service, or server with excessive amounts of traffic so that it becomes unavailable to its normal users
		- Financial and reputational damage
	- Philosophical or Political Beliefs
		- Individuals or groups using hacking to promote a political agenda, social change, or to protest against organisations they perceive as unethical 
		- Hacktivism 
		- Website defacement
		- Data leaks
	- Ethical Reasons
		- Authorised hackers, are motivated by a desire to improve security
		- Pentesters
		- Bounty hunters
		- To improve an organisations security
		- Focus on identifying vulnerabilities
			- on Systems and Networks
	- Revenge
		- An employee who is disgruntled for example
			- Recently fired or laid off
		- Data breaches
		- Disrupting services
		- or leaking sensitive information
	- Disruption or Chaos
		- Motivated by the desire for chaos
		- Unauthorised hackers
		- Engage in malicious activities for the thrill of it, to challenge their skills, or to simply cause harm ...
		- "Some men just want to watch the world burn"
	- Espionage
		- Spying on individuals, organisations, or nations to gather sensitive or classified information
		- Can be motivated by national security interests, when conducted by a nation state
		- Gaining competitive business intelligence when conducted by a rival 
		- Gaining a political advantage 
	- War
		- Cyberattacks have increasingly become a tool for nations to attack each other both on and off the battlefield
		- Economic damage
		- Geopolitical objectives

- In Cybersecurity, it is important to understand the motivations behind different types of threat actor attacks to help formulate an effective defense against them 

- Threat Actor Attributes
	- Internal vs External
	- Resources and Funding
	- Level of sophistication and capability
- Internal TA's
	- Speaks for itself
	- People/entities who have access to internal systems
	- Employees
	- Contractors
	- Who have legitimate access to resources but using that access in an illegitimate way 
	- Revenge, financial gain, or coercion by external entities
- External TAs
	- Speaks for itself
	- Cybercrims
	- Hacktivisits
	- Competitors
	- State sponsored actors
	- Don't have authorised access to system resources
	- Malware, social engineering
- Resources and Funding
	- Refers to the tools, skills and personnel at the actor groups disposal 
- Level of sophistication and capability
	- Refers to their technical skill, the complexity of the tools and techniques they use, and their ability to evade detection and countermeasures

- Threat Actors are scored on a scale from low to high
	- Actors with a low rating
		- Use widely available tools and techniques, such as common malware or phishing attacks
		- Skids
	- High levels
		- Advanced technical skills
		- and use sophisticated skills and techniques
		- Custom made malware
		- APT groups
-
