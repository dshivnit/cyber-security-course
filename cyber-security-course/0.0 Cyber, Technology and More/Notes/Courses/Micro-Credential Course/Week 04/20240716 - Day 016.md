RECAP
- Bit more networking
- Basics and foundation in place (that's the purpose of this first part of the course)
- Switches and Routers
	- Understanding the difference between those
- Network (TCP/IP) model 
	- The four layer model
- MAC Addresses
- MAC Spoofing
- Randomisation of the OS being used
- Hardware randomisation 
- Discussing when recommendations are made, although not tended to, until a much later date
	- Then a best security practice is made
- ARP
- ARP Spoofing
- DHCP
- Rogue DHCP rogue servers
- Wireshark basics

Take note that there are firewalls that operate at each layer (look into this further)
Each layer have vunlerabilities

TCP/IP Model
You'd be looking at all of the below when Wiresharking :) 
- Network
	- MAC Address
- Internet
	- IP Addresses
- Transport
	- TCP/IP or UDP
- Application
	- HTTP
	- SSH
	- Video conferencing
	- VOIP
	- Email
	- Gaming (some sort of protocol is spoken here between the client and the game server(s) )
	- FTP

- TTL 
	- Time To Live
		- How long should a packet be handled by a node (routers and switches) before it gets dropped/discarded

- TCP Handshake
	- Why do we say hello? (authenticating, acknowledging and communicating further)
	- SYN
		- SYN ACK
	- ACK
	- Transfer of data resumes
	- Sequence Ordering with sequence numbers
	- Further ACKs are sent to acknowledge that a seq# has been received or not, or if it has to be retransmitted by the sender
		- Sequence number overflow will restart the count at 0
	- 
										down low, too slow!
	- IP Spofing
	- SYN Flood
	- Slowloris Attack
	- WiFi Portal hijack

Wireshark
- Take note of where various bytes live
	- Meaning, where is the source address located in the packet and how many bytes (in hex) does it take, and its placement
---
- Packets
	- The network you send it over uses fixed-length packets of 1204 bits
		- 1kbit
	- Header of each packets is 96 bits long
	- Trailer is 32 bits long
	- leaving 896 bits for the payload
	- It doesn't have to use all of that, there can be padding that can be encapsulated if needs be
- Ports
	- 0 - 65535
	- 0 is reserved 
		- In relation to a call made to the OS
			- Need to look into this further
			- Usually the OS will give a number from around 40000-60000

- HumINT
	- Intelligence-gathering by means of human sources and interpersonal communication
	- When recommending or suggesting best practices consider the human psyche
- Evil Maid attack
	- An attack is on an unattended device (physical access)
- Rootkits 
	- Root access
- Interacting with an LLM and getting it to give you knowledge that it is not supposed to tell you
	- Bit of an issue this
- File Formats
	- Binary
	- ASCII
	- etc
- ASCII Code table (ascii-code.com)
- UDP address spoofing
- Reflected Attack (DDOS - could be reflected ddos attack)
	- The story given by the master server giving back information/data to the malicious code/querier asking for details of all other game servers
	- then getting other servers connected to that neuro network to start pinging/sending lists of db's from all the servers
- DNSSEC
	- Domain Name System Security Extensions
- Different types of Firewalls
	- How a Firewall can sit/run on the kernel
	- Different performance in terms of being able to pick up unwanted incoming connections before they bypass
- Queries Per Second
	- Throttling
- UDP Spoofing in regards to DDoS attacks
- DPI - Deep Packet Inspection Firewalls
- Session Hijack
- Bit Packing - have a brief look into it
	- For saving space when developing software (perhaps for communication requirements between two nodes)
	- Flags
- Homebrew - package manager for MacOS builds that allows you to install a bunch of utilities
-

- People
	- Peter Gutman
		- Shifted from Cryptology to Human Security
		- You'd find that a lot of new builds (houses) tend to have their kitchens and lounges facing towards the road
			- Perhaps to assist with neighbourhood watch and the like

Terminologies:
- RapidTables - for Hex conversion
- TOTP - Timebased One-time Password
- Fuzzing - have a brief look
	- An automated software testing method that injects invalid, malformed, or unexptec inputs into a system to reveal software defects and vulnerabilities
	- A fuzzing tool injects these inputs the system and then monitors for exceptions such as crashes or information leakage
	- lcamtuf (user) Michael Zor something
		- 10 years or so ago had the idea, how about we make software where we test random combinations of inputs
- Fuzzy-search
	- Autocompleting a search query
	- Example could be completing a command line search by pressing tab
- MDNS
	- Multicast DNS
	- Protocol resolves hostnames to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server
	- Zero-config service
	- Essentially using the same operating semantics as unicast DNS 
- - Just remember that there are 1024 reserved network ports
- IPC - Inter-Process Connection
	- If you have two different processes, and you want them to share memory
- Hotlinking in web development
	- Referencing an image or resource from another websystem
- https://ifconfig.me/

- Linux & HTTP Commands
	- tmux (or something like this to split a terminal window into two - horizontally)
	- nc (netcat) 
		- Doing this to show when listening on ports
		- 
	- curl
	- dig

- Basic HTTP Requests
- Need to have two things
	- METHOD (GET POST etc) PROTOCOL (HTTP etc) VERSION NUMBER (1.1 for example)
		- GET / HTTPS/1.1
	- Host: which site you are trying to get
	- Useragent (optional)
- PGP Key
	- Public Key
	- Can be used for encryption when wanting to speak with the website in question

TODO:
- Touch on your hex lad..... ffs
	- Looking mac addresses, their hex value
	- Converting to binary
	- Just touch on the various values (again... will be good recap :P )
- File Formats
	- Binary
	- ASCII
	- etc
- Check out the ASCII table in Ascii-code.com
	- Refer to the hex dumps from Wireshark and compare and contrast with this code
	- and also get an eye for determining whether something is 
- DNSSEC
	- Domain Name System Security Extensions
	- Look into this further and how it works also how the attack would have worked
- Look up Rapid Tables as well for hex/binary conversion 
- DNS Reflection Attack 
	- Check this out in more detail and describe it in its relevant section
	- Check out the CloudFlare articles in # resources
- Queries Per Second
	- Throttling
- UDP Spoofing in regards to DDoS attacks

	- From MO'G 

- Check out SYN Flooding
- Also Slowloris Attack describe it further
- Is packet spoofing a thing? 
	- Remember the idea you had
- DPI - Deep Packet Inspection Firewalls
- Masquerading as the sender to hijack a session
- etc etc 
- Session Hijack - look into this further
- Also look into what it would take to hijack a TCP connection
- WiFi Portal hijack
- TCP Ordering
- Bit Packing - have a brief look into it
