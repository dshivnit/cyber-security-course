- There will be a clash between
	- security
	- usability
- People want things to be easy, convenient
- People will try to deviate from common security practices for the sake of convenience

- Information Security
	- The data that the systems are holding
	- not the systems themselves
- Information Systems Security
	- Protecting the systems that hold and process the critical data
	- The actual hardware

- CIA Triad
	- Confidentiality
		- Information is only accessible to people who have the proper authorisation
	- Integrity
		- Ensures that the data remains accurate and unaltered unless modification is required
	- Availability
		- Ensures that information and resources are accessible and functional when needed by authorised users

- Non-repudiation
	- A specific action or event has taken place and cannot be denied by the parties involved
		- ie if a sender sends an email and digitally signs it, then they can not deny sending it as their digital signature is attached to the email

- Non-Repudiation 
- Authentication

- AAA
	- Authentication
		- Verifying the identity of a user of a system
	- Authorisation
		- Determines what actions or resources an authenticated user has permission to perform or access
	- Accounting
		- Tracking user activities and resource usage, typically for auditing or billing purposes

- Security Controls
	- Measures or mechanisms put in place to mitigate risks and protect the CIA of info systems and their data
	- Technical
	- Managerial
	- Operational
	- Physical
	- Preventative
	- Deterrent
	- Detective
	- Corrective
	- Compensating
	- Directive

- Zero Trust
	- No one, inside or outside, should be trusted by default
	- Control Plane
		- The adaptive identity
		- Threatt scope reduction
		- Secured Zones
	- Data Plane
		- The subject and system
		- Policy administrator

- Threats and Vulnerabilities
	- Threat
		- Outside of our/the organisations control
		- Anything that can cause damage or harm to information systems and/or data
		- Natural disasters
		- Cyber-attacks
		- Data integrity breaches
		- Disclosure of confidential information
	- Vulnerabiltiies
		- Any weakness in the systems design or implementation
		- They come from internal factors
			- Software bugs
			- Improperly protected network devices
			- so on
		- Within the organisations control
			- Mitigating 
			- Transferring
			- or Accepting risks
	- Remember
		- Threat + no vulnerability
		- or Vulnerability + no threat
			- = no risk

- Confidentiality (ENCRYPTION!)
	- The protection of information from unauthorised individuals, entities or processes
	- Encryption
	- Protect personal privacy, business advantage, achieve regulatory compliance
	- PII
	- PHI
	- Various types of financial data
	- Encryption
	- Access Controls
	- Data Masking
		- Obscuring specific data within a database to make it inaccessible for unauthorised users while retaining the real data's authenticity for access by authorised users
	- Physical Security Measures
	- Training and Awareness

- Integrity (HASHING!)
	- Ensure information and data remain accurate and unchanged from their original state unless intentionally modified by an authorised individual
	- Hashing 
		- Hash digest
		- Digital fingerprint
	- Digital Signatures
		- Use encryption to both ensure integrity and authenticity
	- Checksums
		- Verify the integrity of data during data transmission 
	- Access Controls
		- Only authorised individuals can modify data, and reduce the risk of unintentional or malicious alterations
	- Regular Audits
		- Involve systematically reviewing logs and operations to ensure that only authorised changes have been made to states of the system and any discrepancies have been addressed

- Availability (REDUNDANCY!)
	- Used to ensure that information, systems and resources are accessible and operational when needed by authorised users
	- Three nines:
		- 99.9% uptime
		- 3.5 days of downtime per year..
	- Five nines:
		- 99.999% ! Gold standard
		- 5.26 minutes of downtime per year......
	- Ensuring Business Continuity
		- Every minute of downtime can cost a business/client substantial amounts of money, or consider a hospital - this would relate to lives being lost
	- Maintaining Customer Trust
		- Downtimes can also lead to lowered trust levels from customers
	- Upholding an Organisation's Reputation
		- Company reputation can be tarnished if there are continuous or repeated downtimes
	- Using redundancy in designs is beneficial to ensure availability
		- Server redundancy
			- Using multiple servers in a load balance so that if one is overloaded or fails, the other servers can take over the load to continue supporting end users
		- Data 
			- Involves storing data in multiple places
			- Locally using RAIDs
			- or a hybrid of cloud-based and on-prem systems
		- Network
			- If one network path fails, then there is an alternative route for the network connection to take
			- Say for example a mobile 4G/5G backup 
		- Power
			- UPS
			- Generators
			- A power back up essentially that kicks in when the power goes out
