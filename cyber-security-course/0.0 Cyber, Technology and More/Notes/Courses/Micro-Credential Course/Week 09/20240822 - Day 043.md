- Continuing with SQL and APIs
- Public API Lists
	- Identifying a other side of the API directory structure and database structure from how their API is set up - configured
- Keeping versioning in the API naming convention is good practice
- JSObjects
	- Similar syntax and functionality to that of how Python dictionaries work
- Making sure that URLs aren't enumerable
- Monitor to see if a client is trying to brute force or manipulate URL GET queries to pick up an enumeration pattern
	- Then boot that client/requestor
- Commercial relationships with third-party API developers/companies (over time)
	- Also a huge risk as there is a third-party code/system involved in the organisations business
	- Have alerts set up for the 'in the event' of a third party application/system changing on your own system
		- Treat it perhaps like an exception that throws an alert trigger and notifies escalation teams with priority etc
- One-way hash
- Two-way hash 
	- looks random, but isn't 
- Global Exception Handler
	- Sentry is an example
	- Look into this
- URL shorteners
	- ie bit.ly
		- (Libyan - whole fad happened when Libya was having a revolution)
		- bitly.com
		- linktr.ee
			- Setting up social media links for example
- Never trust users
	- Especially if they're uploading data/stuff/things on to your Web-system

- SQL
- SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE table_column_1 IS "something";

- Using VSCode
	- FastAPI
	- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html

- Python
		- @app.
		- decorator
		- @app.get()

- NoSQL
	- Key:Value
		- ie Redis
			- Storing sessionIDs
	- Graph
	- TimeSeries
	- Non-relational
	- Doesn't use tables, fields, and columns structured

ToDo:
- - Global Exception Handler
	- Sentry is an example
	- Look into this
	- Have a muck around with SQL, VSCode (which sweeeet) and FastAPI
		- Perhaps start doing some further work on the DB Schema you wrote up yesterday - do all this on the Linux distro though ... err Windows
