- Practice and study of writing and solving codes to hide the true meaning of the information
- Encryption - the process of converting ordinary information (plaintext) into an unintelligible form (ciphertext)
- Encryption is to provide protection in:
	- Data at rest
	- Data in transit
		- Data that moves across the network, sits inside RAM, or moves to and from the CPU
	- Data in use
		- Data that is undergoing a current constant state of change
- Cipher - An algorithm that performs the encryption or decryption
- Encryption strength comes from the key, not the algorithm
- Encryption algorithms are open, meaning that the mathematical equations that take place are privy to the public
	- Again, it is the key that is generated that forms the strength of each encryption algorithm
- Key - essential piece of information that determines the output of a cipher
- User larger key lengths, and rotate the keys frequently 
- The length of a key is proportional to the level of security it provides
- Regularly changing cryptographic keys is a best practice
- Most encryption algorithms are open-source and publicly accessible
- Protect the keys!
	- Store in secure hardware modules
	- Encrypt keys when at rest
	- Transmit keys securely when used
- Limit key access to regular audits and monitoring

- Data Masking / Data Obfuscation
	- Process of disguising original data to protect sensitive information while its maintaining its authenticity and usability 

- Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption
	- Symmetric Encryption
		- Single Key
		- Symmetric Algorithm (Private Key)
			- Encryption algorithm in which both the sender and the receiver must know the same shared secret using a privately held key
		- Shared secret key
		- Can't be assured of non-repudiation
			- Multiple handlers of the same private key
		- One main issue is the distribution of the private key
		- Tend to be a 100 to a 1000 times faster than asymmetric algorithms
	- Asymmetric Encryption
		- Two different keys
		- Asymmetric Algorithms (Public Key)
		- One key to encrypt the data, the other to decrypt the data
		- For example:
			- Diffie-Hellman
			- RSA (Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman)
			- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
		- Overcomes the challenge of having to distribute a private key (such as in symmetric algorithms) securely
	- Hybrid implementations
		- Utilises asymmetric encryption to securely transfer a private key that can then be used with symmetric encryption
	- Stream cipher
		- Utilises a keystream generator to encrypt data bit by bit (or byte by byte) using a mathematically XOR function to create the ciphertext
	- Block Cipher
		- Breaks the input into fixed-length blocks of data and performs the encryption on each block
		- Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks, typically of 64, 128, or 256 bits, rather than one bit at a time

- Symmetric Algorithms
	- Method of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data
	- DES and 3DES
		- Data Encryption Standard (DES)
			- Encryption algorithm which breaks the input into 64-bit block and uses transposition and substitution to create ciphertext using an effective key strength of only 56-bits
		- Triple DES (3DES)
			- Because of DES's weakness and its key size
			- Encryption algorithm which uses three separate symmetric keys to encrypt, decrypt, then encrypt the plaintext into ciphertext in order to increase the strength of DES
	- International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)
		- Symmetric block cipher, which uses 64-bit blocks to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext
		- Was really used a lot in the PGP suite of tools
		- DES and 3DES was not strong enough
	- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
		- Symmetric block cipher that uses 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit blocks and a matching encryption key size to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext
	- Blowfish
		- Block cipher that uses a 32-bit to 448-bit encryption key to encrypt 64-bit blocks and a variable length encryption key to encrypt plaintext into cipher text
		- Replacement for DES but not widely utilised
	- Twofish
		- Provides the ability to use 128-bit blocks in its encryption algorithm and uses 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit encryption keys
	- RC Cipher Suite
		- Created by Ron Rivest
		- A cryptographer who's created six algorithms under the name RC which stands for the Rivest Cipher
		- RC4
			- Stream cipher
			- Using a variable key size from 4-bits to 2048-bits that is used in SSL and WEP
		- RC5
			- Block cipher that uses key sizes up to 2048-bits
		- RC6
			- Based on RC5
			- Stronger version of it
	- DES and 3DES
	- IDEA
	- AES
	- Blowfish
	- Twofish
	- Rivest Ciphers (RC4, RC5, RC6)

- Asymmetric Encryption
	- Does not require a shared secret key, often referred to as public key cryptography since their key is considered to be freely and openly available to the public
	- Provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation 
	- Two different keys - one for encryption, and one for decryption
	- Digital Signature
		- A hash digest - encrypted with the senders private key
		- A hash digest of a message encrypted with the sender's private key to let the recipient know the document was created and sent by the person claiming to have sent it
		- Hash digest is sent with the original message
			- To provide non-repudiation
			- Encrypted with the senders private key
		- Encrypt the original message with the receivers public key
		- Non-repudiation, integrity (with the hash digest), confidentiality attained
	-  Diffie-Helman (DH)
		- Used to conduct key exchanges and secure key distribution over an unsecure network
		- Susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks
		- Used for the key exchange inside of creating a VPN tunnel establishment as part of IPSec
	- RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
		- Asymmetric algorithm that relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers
		- Can support key sizes between 1024 - 4096bits
	- ECC - Elliptic Curve Cryptography
		- Heavily used in mobile devices and it's based on the algebraic structure of elliptical curves over finite fields to define its keys
		- ECC with a 256-bit key is just as secure as a RSA with a 2048-bit key
		- Tablets, smartphones, and other mobile based implementation
		- Takes much less processing power
		- ECDH
			- EC Diffie-Helman
			- ECC version of the DH key-exchange protocol
		- ECDHE
			- ECDH Ephemeral
			- Uses a different key for each portion of the key establishment process inside the DH key exchange
		- ECDSA 
			- EC Digital Signature Algorithm
			- Used as a public key encryption algorithm by the US Government in their digital signatures
		- ECC is most commonly used for mobile devices and low-power computing devices
		- Less processing power required to encrypt and decrypt data
	- Diffie-Helman
	- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
	- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

- Hashing
	- Integrity is usually provided through the use of a hashing function
	- One-way cryptographic function that takes an input and produces a unique message digest as its output
	- Another unique thing about a hash digest is that they always going to be the same length (regardless of how many words, characters were hashed)
	- Few main algorithms:
		- MD5
			- Creates a 128-bit hash value that is unique to the input file
			- Unfortunately, due to the small bit size, it can only create a limited amount of unique hash values
			- Which can lead to two files having the same hash digest, ie a hash collision
		- SHA Family
			- Secure Hash Algorithm
			- SHA-1
				- 160-bit hash digest
				- Which reduces the number of collisions that can occur when compared to MD5
			- SHA-2
				- SHA-224
				- SHA-256
				- SHA-384
				- SHA-512
				- Each version of SHA performs a different number of rounds of mathematical computations to create the hash digest
				- 64-80 rounds
			- SHA-3
				- Newer
				- Between 224-bits and 512-bits
				- It has a major increase in security as it uses a 120 rounds of computations to create its message digest 
		- RipeMD
			- RACE Integrity Primitive Evaluation Message Digest
			- 160-bit, 256-bit, 320-bit versions
			- RIPEMD-160
				- Open-source 
				- Created as a competitor to the SHA family
				- Hasn't gained the same level of popularity
		- HMAC
			- Hash-based Message Authentication Code
			- Used to check the integrity of a message and provides some level of assurance that its authenticity is real 
			- HMAC-MD5
			- HMAC-SHA1
			- HMAC-SHA256
			- Depending on the underlying hash that will be used with HMAC
	- Used in Digital Signatures
		- Created by hashing a file and then taking that resulting hash digest and encrypting it with a private key
		- The public key on the receiving end can be used to decrypt it to verify the authenticity of the message
			- Non-repudiation
		- To practically use Digital Signatures, you need to use an algorithm for that, some:
			- Digital Security Algorithm (DSA)
			- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cipher (RSA)
			- Elliptic Curve Cryptography version of either DSA or SHA
		- Digital Security Standard (DSS)
			- Relies upon a 160-bit message digest created by the Digital Security Algorithm
		- Code signing of files relies upon the digital signature of a program file
			- Code Signing
				- Installer files being digitally signed
			- Developers being assigned a Private Key by a provider such as Google, or Apple
			- To verify the integrity of app installations on the mobile market stores
	- Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and produces a unique message digest as its output

- Increasing Hash Security
	- Common attacks:
		- Pass the Hash
			- Hacking technique that allows the attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service by using the underlying hash of a user's password instead of requiring the associated plaintext password
			- Difficult to defend against due to many possible exploits in Windows OS and the apps that run on top of it
			- Hash harvesting - to then be able to used harvested hashes in later attacks
			- Pen Tools:
				- Mimikatz
					- Provides the ability to automate the process of harvesting the hashes and conducting the attack
			- Ensure only trusted OS's can connect to servers
			- Windows Domains have trusts set up properly
			- Workstations are patched and updated
			- Making sure that MFA is being used properly in the network
			- And user accounts have been set up to use the concept of LEAST PRIVILEGED
		- Birthday
			- Occurs when an attacker is able to send two different messages through a hash algorithm and it results in the same identical hash digest, referred to as a collision
			- Trying to create collisions
			- Gets its name from the "Birthday Paradox"
				- "If you have a random group of people, the chances are you are going to have two people in that group with the same birthday"
			- If an attacker can find two identical messages with the same hash, they could use this to attack the system
	- Key Stretching
		- Technique that is used to mitigate a weaker key by increasing the time needed to crack it
		- When you stretch a weaker key, it is run through an algorithm to create a longer more secure key than would normally be used
		- Increases security provided
			- WPA (Wifi Protected Access)
			- WPA2
			- PGP
			- Decrypt
			- and others
		- To mitigate a shorter keys weakness
	- Salting
		- Adding random data into a one-way cryptographic hash to help protect against password cracking techniques
	- Nonce
		- "Number Used Once"
		- Unique, often random number that is added to password-based authentication process
	- Having failed login attempts kept low (like three attempts then account is locked)

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- An entire system of hardware, software, policies, procedures, and people that is based on asymmetric encryption
- PKI can be used to create a symmetric connection such as SSL/TLS
- PKI and Public Key cryptography are not the same thing
- PKI
	- System that creates the asymmetrical key pairs that consist of those public and private keys that are used in the encryption and decryption process
- Public Key Cryptography
	- We are talking just about the encryption and decryption process that is one small part of the entire PKI architecture
- Trusted Third-Parties
	- Certificate Authority
		- Issues digital certificates and keeps the level of trust between all of the certificate authorities around the world
- Key Escrow
	- Process where cryptographic keys are stored in a secure, third-party location, which is effectively an "escrow"
	- In the event that an organisation or an individual loses access to their encryption keys, or in case there is a legal investigation, these keys can be retrieved from that escrow account
	- Controversies:
		- Security
			- What if a threat actor gains access to this escrow's contents
			- Access should be strongly regulated
- PKI
	- Framework for managing digital keys and certificates that facilitate secure data transfer, authentication, and encrypted communications over networks

- Digital Certificates
	- Digitally signed electronic document that binds a public key with a user's identity
	- Can be a person, a server, a workstation or device
	- X.509 Protocol Standard inside of PKI
	- Contain the owner, users information, name, organisation, public key, all the information about the CA too
	- Types:
		- Wildcard
		- Single-sided
		- Dual-sided
		- Self-signed
		- Third-party
		- Root of Trust
		- Certificate Authority (CA)
	- Wildcards Subdomains
		- Wildcard Certs
		- Allows all of the subdomains to use the same public key certificate and have it displayed as valid
		- One certificate, save some money, can make life a bit easier as there is only one cert to manage
		- Disadvantages
			- If the server is compromised or the cert has to be revoked, then all subdomains would be affected as well
		- Subject Alternate Name SAN Field
			- Certificate that specifies what additional domains and IP addresses are going to be supported
	- Single-sided
		- Only requires the server to be validated
		- Only one side of authentication happening
	- Dual-side
		- requires both the server and the user to be validated
		- Better for security
		- Requires more processing power
		- Used in high-security environments
	- Self-Signed Certificates
		- Signed by the same entity whose identity it certifies
		- The identity is claiming its own identity and is vouching for itself
		- There is no external verification of the users identity
		- Used in testing environments, closed systems, and non-production systems where trust is already established
	- Third-Party Certificates
		- Issued and signed by a CA (Certificate Authority)
		- Root Certificates embedded into web-browsers, or OSes
		- Higher-degree of trust and level of security
		- Preferred choice for any public facing systems
	- Root of Trust
		- Each certificate is validated using the concept of a root of trust or the chain of trust
		- Goes from the bottom to the top
		- Consider it like a family-tree
		- Certification path
	- Certificate Authority
		- Trusted third party who is going to issue these digital certificates
	- Registration Authority
		- Requests identifying information from the user and forwards that certificate request up to the CA to create the digital certificate
	- CAs maintain a publicly visible record of public keys of registered/certified digital certificates
	- Certificate Signing Request
		- Block of encoded text that contains information about the entity requesting the certificate
		- Including, organisation name, domain name, locality and country 
		- CSR's include the entity's public key
	- Private Key is always kept with the requestor (maintains confidentiality, integrity and so on)
	- Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
		- Serves as an online list of digital certificates that the certificate authority has already revoked
	- OCSP
		- Online Certificate Status Protocol
		- Allows to determine the revocation status of any digital certificate using its serial number
	- OCSP Stapling
		- Allows the certificate holder to get the OCSP record from the server at regular intervals
		- Includes it as part of the SSL/TLS handshake
		- Speeds up the tunnel creation process
	- Public Key Pinning
		- Allows an HTTPS website to resist impersonation attacks from users who are trying to present fraudulent certificates
	- Key Escrow Agents
		- Occurs when a secure copy of a user's private key is being held
		- Recommended to have two separate administrators present (if not more) when a key request is made from the escrow
		- Helps to implement the concept of separation of duties as well
	- Key Recovery Agent
		- Specialised type of software that allows the restoration of a lost or corrupted key to be performed
		- Consider it as a backup of all the CAs keys incase a major incident or disaster occurs

Blockchain
- A shared immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets, and building trusts
- A really long series of information with each block containing information
- Each block also contains the hash for the block before it
- Public ledger
	- A record-keeping system that maintains participants' identities in a secure and anonymous format
- p2p network
- A series of hashes are used to ensure the system is recorded properly, and nobody can change it without proper permission - that way everything is authenticated and stored throughout the related blockchain
- Smart Contracts
	- Self-executing contracts where the terms of agreement or conditions are written directly into lines of code
	- The decentralised and transparent nature of the blockchain ensures that once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be altered, making the agreement tamper-proof and trustworthy
- Potential to automate complex processes, and operations - from business transactions up to governance systems
- Reduce the risk of fraud
- Offers transparency
- Reduces the cost of traditional contractual processes
- Every executed contract action is also recorded on the blockchain
	- So there is a clear and indisputable record of all the transactions that reinforces the concept of trust inside of our digital dealings
- Commercial uses:
	- IBM is focused on getting the blockchain into the use inside of the commercial environment
	- Permissioned Blockchain
		- Used for business transactions and it promotes new levels of trust and transparency using this immutable public ledger
		- Use within the supply chain
			- To know exactly when and where a particular product item comes from say for example (ie food - from the source, through to the grocery store)
		- Because it's inside the immutable public ledger, nobody can modify it and we all know exactly where everything has been located and what has been done to it
- Not just limited to the financial sector or cyptocurrencies
	- Its applications and potential span a wide array of industries
- Examples:
	- Supply Chain Management
	- Voting Systems
	- Intellectual Property Protection
	- Property Transfers
	- Many more

- Encryption Tools
	- TPM
		- Trusted Platform Module
		- Dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys
		- Offer hardware level security that ensures digital secrets remain confidential and unaltered
		- Kind of like a personal vault that information remains encrypted and safeguarded from being tampered with or unauthorised access
		- One common use is with BitLocker Drive Encryption feature on a MS Windows system
			- Securing cryptographic keys inside the isolated hardware, we add an additional layer of security against software-based attacks
	- HSM
		- Hardware Security module
		- Physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys, primarily used for mission-critical situations like financial transactions
		- Like a high-security bank vault
		- Physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys, primarily used for mission-critical situations like financial transactions
		- HSM will perform encryption operations within a tamper proof environment, makes it a reliable choice for sensitive operations
		- Can securely create cryptographic keys, and also accelerate cryptographic operations - all within a tamper-proof device
		- Securely generates crypto keys also provides accelerated cryptographic operations
		- Companies will often rely on Hardware Security Modules to meet regulatory standards when dealing with sensitive data
		- Example:
			- An online retailer needing to ensure that each transaction is encrypted using keys generated and stored within their HSM, this could ensure that if the retailers system and databases were breached - the financial details about each transaction would remain safely encrypted, due to the individual keys that are used by that Hardware Security Module when encrypting that data that were protecting using the systems encryption processes 
	- Key Management Systems (KMS)
		- Integrated approach for generating, distributing and managing cryptographic keys for devices and applications
		- Centralised mechanism that controls the entire lifecycle of these cryptographic keys, from inception/creation to their eventual retirement/destruction
		- Example:
			- If you're working for a digital media company with a requirement for a vast amount of cloud storage, that needs to store all their multimedia content, project files, contracts and more - you want to ensure that each of those files are encrypted for security
			- Imagine if you need to manage unique encryption keys for each of these files manually would be more than arduous
			- With the Key Management System - you can ensure that the system automatically manages those keys and refreshes them periodically to enhance security, and to ensure that old ones are retired when new ones are introduced into the system
	- Secure Enclave
		- Coprocessor that is integrated into the main processor of some devices 
		- With the sole purpose of ensuring data protection
		- Its architecture is such that it is separated from the main processor and provides a shielded location for safe processing and storing of your sensitive data
		- It's like a fortress inside your device
		- Safeguards fingerprints, payment information
		- By keeping this data separate even if the device gets compromised, the data within the Secure Enclave remain untouched 
- TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
- HSM (Hardware Security Module)
- KSM (Key Management System)
- Secure Enclave

- Obfuscation
	- Obscuring information can be sometimes as crucial as encrypting it
	- Steganography
	- Data Masking
		- Also known as data obfuscation
		- Used to protect data by ensuring that it remains recognisable but does not actually include sensitive information
		- Also known as data obfuscation
		- Process of disguising original data to protect sensitive information while maintaining data authenticity and usability
		- Example:
			- Let's pretend that you're working for a software company that wants to test new features
			- Dev's need realistic data to work with, but working with live data can be risky
			- Using Data Masking to replace customer names, addresses with alterations or made up details - so they don't point to actual/factual values
			- Doesn't expose any genuine information
			- By creating a sanitised version of datasets, businesses are able to reduce the risk of a data breach in non-production environments
		- Data masking is also really prevalent in industries that handle vast amounts of personal data
		- Hiding sensitive details from company's own employees
			- ie, not having the full credit card number showing up when authorising an account - as it's usually only the last four digits that would be visible to employee operators
	- Tokenization
		- Transformative technique in data protection that involves substituting sensitive data elements with non-sensitive equivalents, called tokens, which have no meaningful value
		- Example:
			- Using a credit card at a store, the actual credit card details aren't stored, but a tokenized version of the credit card number/details is - replaced with a random string of numbers, called a token. 
			- This token can be used for internal processes, without exposing the actual credit card number
			- If a breach occurs, threat actors will only find that useless token, not the actual numbers, because the actual numbers remain safe in a separate secured vault
	- Steganography
		- Derived from Greek words meaning "covered writing," and it is all about concealing a message within another so that the very existence of the message is hidden
		- Concealing a message within another message, so the very existence of that very message, is unknown
		- Primary goal - to prevent the suspicion that there is any hidden data at all
		- Frequently used alongside encryption for an extra layer of security as well
		-
