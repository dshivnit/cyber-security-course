- LoRA - Low-Rank Adaptation || Learned Rank Augmentation || A wireless modulation technique
	- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is **a technique designed to refine and optimise large language models**. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that require extensive retraining of the entire model, LoRA focuses on adapting only specific parts of the neural network.22 Jan 2024 (from deeperinsights.com/ai-blog)
	- A LoRA (short for Learned Rank Augmentation) model is **a small model that is applied on top of a standard image generation model like Stable Diffusion**. It allows for fine-tuning of the base model without having to retrain the whole model from scratch, which can be very time-consuming and resource-intensive. (from a reddit board)
	- LoRa is a wireless modulation technique derived from **Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)** technology. It encodes information on radio waves using chirp pulses - similar to the way dolphins and bats communicate! LoRa modulated transmission is robust against disturbances and can be received across great distances. (https://linovision.com/blogs/blogs/what-are-lora-and-lorawan-and-why-is-lorawan-so-awesome#:~:text=LoRa%20is%20ideal%20for%20applications,operate%20in%20low%20power%20mode.)

- YARA Rule
	- Yet Another Recursive Acronym
	- A set of instructions that define the characteristics of a specific type of malware or threat. 
	- Used for:
		- Detecting and classifying malicious software
		- Identifying digital artifacts, such as files and hex sequences
		- Scanning backups for health and recoverability
		- Defending against malware
		- Hunting for bad guys (lel)
	- Text-based descriptions of patterns that can be used to match against files and processes, they are made up of:
		- A rule identifier
		- A description with three sections:
			- The meta
			- The strings
			- The condition
		- Sets of strings, regular expressions, and condition logic
		- A syntax that starts with the word "rule"
	- Highly customisable and can be tailored to meet the requirements of an organisation
- Differential Sync
	- This has to do with cloud storage, or remote storage
	- When the app only syncs modified parts of a file that is already in/on online storage, not the entire file. 
	- Significantly reduces synchronization time, especially when working with large files
	- Also saves on bandwidth when on metered connections as well.

- Big-endian and Little-Endian
	- Two ways of storing bytes in computer memory
	- Endianness - refers to the order in which bytes are stored
	- Big-Endian
		- The most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address
		- Used in network communications and file storage
	- Little-Endian
		- The least significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address
		- Used in SMB protocol
	- Endianness is important when transferring data between systems or processing data on systems with different endianness
	- Also important when using Unicode characters, which require a Byte Order Mark (BOM) to indicate the endian order of the incoming stream
- BOM - Byte Order Mark
	- A sequence of bytes that indicates how a text file is encoded
	- It's placed at the beginning of a text file or stream
	- Tells the reader how to decode the text into characters
	- Identifies the encoding scheme used
	- Indicates the byte order of the text
	- Commonly used in XML files
	- Optional for UTF-8
	- Required for UTF-16 and UTF-32
