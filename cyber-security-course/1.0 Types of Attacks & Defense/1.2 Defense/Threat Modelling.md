Overview
- Threat modelling is a systematic approach to **identifying**, **prioritising**, and **addressing potential security threats** across the organisation
- Through the simulation of possible attack scenarios and the assessment of existing vulnerabilities of the organisation's interconnected systems and applications, threat modelling enables organisations to develop proactive security measures and make informed decisions about resource allocation
- Threat modelling aims to reduce an organisation's overall risk exposure by identifying vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors
	- Allowing for adequate security controls and strategies
- Threat modelling is essential for constructing a robust defence strategy against the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape

Threat, Vulnerability and Risk
- Threat
	- Any potential occurrence, event, or actor that may exploit vulnerabilities to compromise information confidentiality, integrity, or availability
	- Various forms such as cyber attacks, human error, or natural disasters for example
	- ie - Occurrence of someone breaking inside your home and taking all your belongings
- Vulnerability
	- A weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that may be exploited by a threat to cause harm 
	- It may arise from software bugs, misconfiguration, or design flaws for example
	- ie Weaknesses in your home security, such as broken locks or open windows
- Risk
	- The possibility of being compromised because of a threat taking advantage of a vulnerability
	- A way to think about how likely an attack might be successful and how much damage it could cause
	- ie Likelihood of being burglarised due to living in a neighbourhood with a high crime rate or a lack of an alarm system

High-level Process of Threat Modelling
- 1. Defining the Scope
	- Identify the specific systems, applications, and networks in the threat modelling exercise
- 2. Asset Identification
	- Develop diagrams of the organisation's architecture and its dependencies
	- Also essential to identify the importance of each asset based on the information it handles, such as customer data, intellectual property, and financial information
- 3. Identify Threats
	- Identify potential threats that may impact the identified assets, such as cyber attacks, physical attacks, social engineering, and insider threats
- 4. Analyse Vulnerabilities and Prioritise Risks
	- Analyse the vulnerabilities based on the potential impact of identified threats in conjunction with assessing the existing security controls
	- Given the list of vulnerabilities, risks should be prioritised based on their likelihood and impact
- 5. Develop and Implement Countermeasures
	- Design and implement security controls to address the identified risks, such as implementing access controls, applying system updates, and performing regular vulnerability assessments
- 6. Monitor and Evaluate
	- Continuously test and monitor the effectiveness of the implemented countermeasures and evaluate the success of the threat modelling exercise
	- An example of a simple measurement of success is tracking the identified risks that have been effectively mitigated or eliminated
