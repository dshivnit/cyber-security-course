- Windows stuff

	- Most of the tools built with C#
	- hosts file editor
	- Redirects DNS calls to an IP address
	- The /etc/hosts file **contains the Internet Protocol (IP) host names and addresses for the local host and other hosts in the Internet network**. This file is used to resolve a name into an address (that is, to translate a host name into its Internet address). - taken from IBM.com
	- A text file in a TCP/IP network that _specifies the IP addresses of computer names and domain names_. It is used to convert a request by name to a numeric IP (taken from pcmag.com)
	- AdBlocking software tends to work in a similar fashion
		- Keeps a list of tracking website > and redirects any traffic to a malicious website to your own computer (meaning that there isn't any traffic coming in from the bogus site)
		- These lists can get quite large and AdBlockers ...(find out more)
	- These hosts file live in both environments, Windows and Unix-based systems
- DOXING
	- Documents (back in the day)
	- PII (personally identifiable information)
	- Doxing is when someone gets PII and leaks it online
	- 
Threat Modelling
- Undersea Cabelling
	- Fishing trawlers
	- Sharks
		- Having electromagnetic sensors on the tip of their noses - there have been cases of them biting undersea cables
	- Underwater Volcanos, Geysers (Michelle)
	- Tectonic plate movement (earthquakes)
	- Other countries tapping into cables
		- splices the fibre cable, people using it will notice a flicker in service, and then start redirecting the traffic elsewhere (essentially sniffing)

- DNS Route Servers
  https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/
	- https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers
	- https://root-servers.org/
	- Operator Groups
		- https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/
		  Check out the discussion topics that take place here
		- NZNOG.og
			- og - operators group
	- A Servers 
		- A collection of top-level domains (TLD)
			- What comes at the very end of a domain name 
			- GTLD - generic .com .net .org and so on
			- CCTLD - Country Code TLDs - .nz .au .se . us .tk .tw .to .ws etc
	- F Servers
		  - Internet Systems Consortium
		  - The most important root servers
	- If your computer doesn't have a DNS record handy locally, it will then ask your gateway/router > which will then ask the Network Service Provider in most cases (they have their own DNS servers which can resolve addresses or speak with other DNS servers that can resolve the name and get back to you in the end through all the routes that take place)
	- Root Servers
	- Verisign are the ones who manage the .com TLD space
	- ICANN are the authority of domain names
		- Verisign back in 2003 > when typing an website domain name used to give an error > Verisign tried to redirect users to a website to give them the opportunity to purchase the domain name
			- Domain squatter > "hey purchase this domain name" so on
			- They yoink domain names and resell them to the entity that originally had it for a higher price - cheers mayte
	- DNC - Domain Name Commission 
		- Responsible for all the local TLD's that are sold
		- ie searching for DNC NZ Registrars (https://dnc.org.nz/tools-and-services/find-a-nz-provider/nz-authorised-registrars/)
		- Anonymization
	- DNS Host
		- Maintain zone files (.txt file) 
			- keeps track of what subdomain points to what IP address
			- 
	- WhoIs 
		- on a domain name will query the whois information for the Domain Name
		- If you perform a WhoIs on an IP Address
			- Will show you who is leasing the address and from which registry
	- Name Servers
		- Authoritative Name Servers
		- Typically you'd have two (for the sake of redundancy)
	- Example john.com
		- DNS Resolver > looks up .com TLD registrar > whois name servers > returns details of the name servers that are used > returns it back to the sender
			- (describe this in better detail - this is flimsy)
	- ICANN
		- Responsible for DNS
	- IANA
		- Responsible for the TLD names
	- NIC
		- Network Information Centre

- RIR - Regional Internet Registry
	- The Internet is broken up into different regions
	- APNIC - Asia/Pacific Network Information Centre
	- LACNIC - Latin
	- AFRINIC - African
	- ARIN - American Registry for Internet Numbers
	- 
		1992 (RIPE NCC) - [Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPE_NCC "RIPE NCC")

		2004 (AFRINIC) - [African Network Information Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFRINIC "AFRINIC")

- ARPANET
	- Advanced Research Project Agency Network
	- Early days of the Internet
- DARPANET
	- ARPANET now called DARPANET

	CIDR
		- Classless Inter-Domain Routing
	- 

- IP Addresses
	- WhoIs (program/command - you'll need to install this on some shells, bear that in mind)
	- whois (ip)
		- CIDR
	- CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing
		- Subnetting (good topic)
		- Whacks
	- Classful Addresses:
		- A: 0-127
		- B: 127-192
		- C: 192-223
	- Reserved/Private Addresses
- Access Control Lists (ACL)
	- 

- Networks
  DIALUP
	- POTS
	- Dial-Up - Access to the Internet running on the POTS network
	- Would need an associated phone number
	- Use of telephone exchanges
	- Period of time wherein a hacker would be able to emulate the sounds of the touch-tone devices (phones not the dial ones) called phreaking
		- Using the existing POTS network to make phone calls for free
			- As different carriers would charge their fees - in particular for international calls
		- A bluebox - a little device where you could press buttons on it and send those tones down the line > exchange would receive it > and then the phone call would send it to a certain location
		- Cap'n Crunch - some blind dude had super hearing hearing ability would then be able to recreate a super tone dial to get into admin mode somewhere -- Kris will link a doco to it
		- Steve Wozniak had a part to play somewhere along the way (co-founder of Apple)
		- Hacking movements sprung up around this
- ADSL (Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line)
	- Technology that sends frequencies above a range from what humans can hear
	- Also provided faster speeds for signals to transfer when compared to dial-up
- VDSL - Very High Speed DSL (or Very High Bit-rate DSL)
- LLU - Local Loop Unbundling
	- Took some petitioning to take the control/monopoly away from Telecom (now Spark) to allow other Service Providers to have their gear at the local Telephone Exchanges
	- Bloody Telescum..... xD good times this, when LLU was brought into play

- NZ Post owned the copper-network to begin with from where the NZ taxpayer had paid for installation of the network through the country
- Telecom then had bought the network out
- Look into the history of this, this is our country - would be good to know :)

##---------------------------------
TERMINOLOGIES:
- EULA - End-User License Agreement
- DNS Root Servers 
- DNC - Domain Name Commision(er)
- BIND - to hose your own DNS Servers
- DNS Records
	- MX Record - Mail Exchange record (ie mail.example.tld) > for email handling
	- A Record - A name to an IP address 
	- AAA Record - A name to a IPv6 address
	- CNAME - Canonical Name > fancy term that means it's a name pointing to another name (if there is a full-stop at the end of this with nothing after it, it will tell the resolver to stop --> or you get a loop that happens if the . is missing at the end to kill the processing happening)
	- SOA - Start of Authority - holds important information about a domain or zone such as the email address of the admin, when the domain was last updated, how long the server should wait before refreshes. 
- TTL - Time To Live
	- (in the context of DNS processing - it tells the host that is caching the DNS record how long to keep the record for before probing for another one, or just simply removing it - to renew it if needs be at a later stage)
