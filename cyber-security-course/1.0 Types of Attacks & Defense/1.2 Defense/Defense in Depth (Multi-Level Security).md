Refers to creating a security system of multiple levels - also called Multi-Level Security

Example:
- You have important documents you keep in a filing cabinet. You lock this cabinet. 
- That's one layer of security, but what about taking it further? 
- Locking the door to the room that has the filing cabinet with your important documents
- The entire building which houses that room being locked, and secured (windows, doors, any entry-point)
- A perimeter safe-guarding that building, perhaps a wall, or a fence. 
- Perhaps some dogs inside that perimeter
- Some security cameras
- Light-towers around the area to light up dark areas when it gets dark
- Bollards around the perimeter so that cars/vehicles can't ram through it
- And so on
- This can be considered multi-level security, or defense in depth
