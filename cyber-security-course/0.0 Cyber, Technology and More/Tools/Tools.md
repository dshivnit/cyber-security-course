Tools mainly being used so far in this course will be described here (note - there are HEAPS out there - refer to the Book of "Secret" Knowledge - lel, secret)
*Perhaps put these into their own sections and further expand.
ie Windows applications/software, Other OS applications/software, PowerShell tools, Unix/Linux shell tools - differentiating between the different shells if relevant (bash, zsh etc) - atm this section is all jumbled up*

- Everything
	- Pretty neat, kind of like Finder in MacOS, real fast to search for stuff when compared to your usual File Explorer in Windows
	- voidtools.com
	- Quick filename indexing
- Burp Suite
	- Software security application used for penetration testing of web applications
	- Well-known use cases involve scanning for many types of vulnerabilities.
	- Can identify common security flaws such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-site Scripting), CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery), and more..
	- https://portswigger.net/burp
- Nessus
	- Made by Tenable
	- A proprietary vulnerability scanner
	- Alternative to Burp Suite
	
- PuTTY - Pretty Useful Teletypewriter
	- Good way to telnet, SSH so on so forth to machines

- Have I Been Pwned?

- nmap
	- NSE - NMap Scripting Engine
		- Written in the Lua programming language
			- Scanning for vulns
			- Automating exploits
			- Recon
			- Categories:
				- safe - won't affect the target
				- intrusive - not safe, most likely will affect the target
				- vuln - probing for vulns
				- exploit - attempt to exp a vuln
				- auth - attempt to bypass authentication for running services (like FTP)
				- brute - attempt to bf creds for running services
				- discovery - query running services for further info on the network
		- --script=< script_name > (can use commas to run multiple scripts at za same time)
		- /usr/share/nmap/scripts
			- alluvdem
			- script.db (for details of the list)
	- ping sweep
		- nmap will send an ICMP packet to each possible IP address in the given network
			- It will mark valid responses as active hosts
			- Forms somewhat of a baseline
			- (do you want to accept ICMP or not?)
				- -sn ip_netaddr.+1-254 for example
	- **-p- asks Nmap to scan every possible TCP port**, -v asks Nmap to be verbose about it, -A enables aggressive tests such as remote OS detection, service/version detection, and the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE). Finally, -T4 enables a more aggressive timing policy to speed up the scan. (nmap.org)
	- https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/
	- -open : Only show open (or possibly open) ports
	- example: nmap -open -p- -T5 *ip_address/hostname*
		- This will scan for all open ports
		- Scanning all ports up to 65535 (max number of possible ports)
		- Trying to go as fast as it can
	- -sV : Probe open ports to determine service/version info
	- -sC : equivalent to --script=default
	- -p- : scan all ports
	- -sT
		- TCP Connect Scans
	- -sS
		- SYN "Half-open" scans, or "stealth" scans
		- Second packet sent is an RST to stop the other side from repeatedly trying to get an ACK back (this is after getting a SYN/ACK from it)
		- Some services are bought down by SYN scans
			- Keep this in mind if the client (or scenario) involves a Prod Env
		- Can be issued with CAP_NET_RAW, CAP_NET_ADMIN, CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
			- keep note that this may bugger some of the NSE scripts to run
		- SYN scans do not form the whole three-way handshake, 'member that
			- Hence why they're considered half-open and stealthy, as most detection systems will only pick up active connections, wherein a handshake has been completed
				- *This to be contested with further research down the line and testing*
	- -sU
		- UDP Scans
		- UDP ports don't respond. (response given by end-node is "open|filtered")
			- Closed is closed (unreachable)
			- Responses given with ICMP
		- Consider, top 20 ports being UDP scanned (system design to revert commonly used ports and so on)
		- UDP scans with NMAP take a long, long time. 
	- -sN
		- TCP Null Scans
		- No flag packet sent
	- -sF
		- TCP FIN Scans
		- FIN flag packet sent
	- -sX
		- TCP Xmas Scans
		- A radiated mungbean packet is sent
				The last three above will expect a 'open|filtered' 'closed' or 'filtered' response
				if a filtered response is given, the other side sent an ICMP packet
				RFC 793 states that hosts respond to malformed (radiated mungbean ;) ) packets with a RST TCP packet for ports that are closed
					No response at all for open ports.
				Consider:
					Most firewalls drop TCP packets to blocked ports which have the SYN flag set.
						Sending packets which aren't with a SYN flag steps through this (depends on *design* and config)
					Windows and Cisco devices respond with an RST packet to a radiated mungbean incoming packet
						Which describes a closed port, when in actuality it is open.
	- -Pn
		- Don't send an ICMP / ping packet before scanning 
		- nmap will treat the host as being alive
			- bypasses ICMP blocks
			- Takes a flapping long time (even if the host truly is offline, or not there)
				consider: ARP
	- -f
		- Fragment packets
	- --mtu (maximum transmittable unit) < number >
		- (has to be a multiple of 8)
	- --scan-delay < time >ms
	- --badsum
		- bad bad
	- -sn
		- ICMP network sweep
		- can also do subnet masks
		- either ICMP or ARP (sudo'd)

	- Tools like mimikatz, NTDS.dit
	- unshadow
		- `unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]`

		- Gecos
			- ie the passwd file and the shadow file have colons :'s that seperate variables
