- Any software that is designed to infiltrate a computer system without the user's knowledge
-  Malware needs to create a threat vector and an attack vector
	- Threat Vector
		- Specific method used by an attacker to infiltrate a victim's machine
		- The how, the plan, to get into a system
			- Unpatched software
			- Installing code on via a USB thumbdrive
			- Phishing campaign
			- Other vulns and exploits that can be taken advantage of
	- Attack Vector
		- A means by which an attacker gains access to a computer to infect the system with malware
		- Breaking into and infecting a system

- Malware Attacks
	- Ransomware
	- Trojan
	- Worm
	- Spyware
	- Bloatware
	- Virus
	- Keylogger
	- Logic bomb
	- Rootkit

- Virus
	-  Malicious software that attaches to clean files and spreads into a computer system
- Worms
	- Standalone malware programs that replicate and spread to other systems by exploiting software vulnerabilities
- Trojans
	- Malicious programs which appear to be legitimate software that allow unauthorised access to a victim's system when executed
- Ransomware
	- Encrypts a user's data and holds it hostage until a ransom is paid before decrypting it
- Zombies
	- Compromised computers that are remotely controlled by attackers and used in coordination to form a botnet
	- Botnet
		- Network of zombies and are often used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, or cryptocurrency mining
- Rootkits
	- Malicious tools that hide their activities and operate at the OS level, or below!, to allow for ongoing privileged access
- Backdoors
	- Malicious means of bypassing normal authentication processes to gain unauthorised access to a system
- Logic Bombs
	- Embedded code placed in legitimate programs that executes a malicious action when a specific condition or trigger occurs
- Keyloggers
	- Stealthy tools or malware variants used to capture keystores or capture passwords or other sensitive information
- Spyware
	- Software that secretly monitors and gathers user information or activities and sends data to third parties
- Bloatware
	- Unnecessary or pre-installed software that consumes system resources and space without offering any value to the user

- Malware exploitation techniques
	- Involve methods by which malware infiltrate and infects targeted systems

- Viruses
	- Malicious code that's run on a machine without the user's knowledge and this allows the code to infect the computer whenever it has been run
	- Will want to spread across the system and network for the most part
	- Start using resources on the system
	- Types:
		- Boot Sector
			- Stored in the first sector of a hard drive and is then loaded into memory whenever the computer boots up
			- To find and remove these viruses, use an antivirus that specifically looks for boot sector viruses
		- Macro
			- A form of code that allows a virus to be embedded inside another document so that when that document is opened by the user, the virus is executed 
		- Program
			- Tries to find executables or application files to infect with their malicious code 
			- Infecting one application say for example, so that whenever it opens up the virus runs and starts to do its thing - will reinfect the system time after time after the user opens the infected application
		- Multipartite
			- Combination of a boot sector and program type of virus
			- The virus can place itself in the boot sector, then when its loaded up at boot time, it can then install itself to launch whenever the infected application is launched
				- So even if an anti-virus program happens to find the infection on the given application, it may have missed the boot-sector part of the virus
		- Encrypted
			- Designed to hide itself from being detected by encrypting its malicious code or payloads to avoid detection by any antivirus software 
			- May get harder for antivirus providers from finding these encrypted variants as it could be scrambled encrypted in code
		- Polymorphic
			- Advanced version of an encrypted virus, but instead of just encrypted the contents, it will actually change the virus's code each time it is executed by altering the decryption module in order for it to evade detection
		- Metamorphic
			- Able to rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to infect a given file
			- More advanced version of a polymorphic virus
		- Stealth
			- Not necessarily a specific type of virus as much as it is a technique used to prevent the virus from being detected by the anti-virus software
		- Armored Virus
			- A layer of protection to confuse a program or a person who's trying to analyse it
		- Hoax
			- A form of technical social engineering that attempts to scare end users into taking undesirable action on their system
	- A virus is simply made up of malicious code that's run on a machine without the user's knowledge and this allows the code to infect the computer whenever it has been run
