PROGRAMMING
https://web.archive.org/web/20150406052855/http://abstrusegoose.com/249
Covering Programming today woo
	- Python - good way to go
		- Replit is a good ground for this as they have the runtime environment going on the fly
- Syntax
	- The structure of statements in a computer language
	- There will be differences in the syntax of different languages, just like spoken languages that human's use
- Pseudocode
	- A notation resembling a simplified programming language, used in program design.
	- ALWAYS WRITE UP A PSEUDOCODE - it actually does help.
- LLM - Large Language Models
- CoPilot
	- You can change parameters
		- ie you type in "good" possible suggestions that can come up are morning, night, day etc
- Comments
	  - usually identified by symbols like # for example, or ##, or // (tells the computer to ignore whatever is in the text, it is there "for humans" .. lol)
	- Python: #
	- C, C#, Javascript: //
	- ALWAYS COMMENT - for the sake of your own sanity and also others (but mainly for yourself - and also get into good habits when commenting - don't be a slack derpaderp.)
	- Comment will state the intent of what the following block of code will be
- Imports
	- Importing from other libraries of the programming language being used	
- Languages
	- Abstraction
		- A programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency. In the same way that abstraction sometimes work in art, the object that remains is a representation of the original, with unwanted detail omitted. (TechTarget)
	- Functions
		- Every language has a way to specify the name of the function
		- How you get stuff out of the function
		- Blocks
			- Languages like to break the code into 'blocks' - ie, functions, you have input, then some output generally speaking
		- Function Signature
			- How many inputs do we have?
			- What data will the Function use
			- What kind of output will we give out
		- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
	- Classes
		- Expand on this later
	- Primitive Data Types
		- integers - ie numbers
		- strings
		- decimals
		- etc
	- Complex Data Type
		- A collection of primitive data types
		- Group up prim data types into abstract form, ie a person
	- Religious Wars (lel)
		- Do we use tabs as characters in this language?
		- Do we recognise space characters as whitespace or as characters? 
	- Whitespace characters
	- Python
		- #! - special comment
			- At the start of code
			- Also called hashbang, or shebang
			- If you run ! on a Unix shell > you can do a series of different things
			- ie #!/usr/bin/env python3 will take python3 from the env PATH as stated
			- DocString - Documentation Strings
				- Have a look into this further
				- Example:
					  """ 
					  Example DocString which describes what is happening in a function or bit of code 
					  Surrounded here by three double-quote characters
					  """ 
			- def
				- How you define a function
			- return
				- output the result of the functions code
			- - Line Comment - #
			- Block Comment - """ *content* """
			- import
				- import code from various library names (these would go at the very start of your code)
		- Classes - Python has some support for classes
		- 
	- C
	- C#
	- Java
	- Javascript
		- node.js
	- Scheme
	- LISP
	- JScript
	- Actionscript
	- AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML 
	- Brainfuck language (what's currently going on in me head right now :P )
	- FRACTRAN

- DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)
	- DMCA takedowns are when content is removed due to copyright violations
- AES encryption - Advanced Encryption Standard
- Padding Size - when there is a padding size > 
- Remember that hash is one-way
- Encryption however, is a way wherein it can be reversed (if needs be, with brute force methodology say)
- Decrypt is the reversal of encryption
- Plaintext - plain form of any kind of data, can be an image, video/movie, anything that doesn't have any encryption on it
	- Plaintext (PT) > (key symbol or K) Encryption > CipherText (CT) 
- Symmetric Key Encryption 
	- your key locks and unlocks, encrypts and decrypts text
- Asymmetric Key Encryption
	- Uses two keys
		- Public key (what you share with everyone else, this can lock something)
		- Private key (what the encryptor keeps themselves, does not share this with anyone else)
		- Port 443 uses this
- PGP - Pretty Good Privacy
- Key Server
- Cyberchef (on Github) - https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
	- A Web App for encryption, encoding, compression and data analysis. 
- Quantum Computing!!
	- qbits
- Entropy
	- Entropy, in the context of cryptography, is **related to random number generation, and more precisely, it refers to the “amount of unpredictable randomness**” in a physical system. We call an entropy source the physical system that produces random signals. (Quside)
	- "not much entropy in that number generation"
- 0-Day (or zero-day) vulnerability
	- Special type of bug where people have not had any time to prepare any defense for
	- - A zero-day is a vulnerability in software or hardware that is typically unknown to the vendor and for which no patch or other fix is available. The vendor has zero days to prepare a patch as the vulnerability has already been described or exploited. (Wikipedia)

		- Responsible disclosure
			- If the company has found it 
	- CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scorign System
- Bug Bounty
	- Public disclosure
	- Some money allocated to the security researcher who finds the vulnerability

Breakout Room - Page 5
https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2024-4577
In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, when using Apache and PHP-CGI on Windows, if the system is set up to use certain code pages, Windows may use "Best-Fit" behavior to replace characters in command line given to Win32 API functions. PHP CGI module may misinterpret those characters as PHP options, which may allow a malicious user to pass options to PHP binary being run, and thus reveal the source code of scripts, run arbitrary PHP code on the server, etc.

Affecting PHP versions 
8.1.* before 8.1.29, 
8.2.* before 8.2.20, 
8.3.* before 8.3.8
When using Apache and PHP-CGI on Windows (ie Windows Server 2019 Datacenter)
	- CGI program is a protocol for transferring information between a Web Server and a CGI program
	- CGI - Common Gateway Interface
		- Provides an interface between the HTTP server and programs generating web content
