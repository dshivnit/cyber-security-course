	- Implemented differently based on the platform/vendor/user
		- ie Network infrastructure devices
			- Switches, routers, firewalls etc
	- Security Control Categories
		- Managerial/administrative
			- What should be done?
			- Employee background checks
		- Operational
			- How often do we do it? 
			- Periodic review of security policies
		- Technical
			- How will we do it?
			- ie Firewall configurations/rules

- Risk Assessments and Treatments
	- Prioritising threats against assets of an organisation and then determining what to do about them
	- Can be applied to the whole organisation 
	- Can be applied to a single project or department
	- Could be for specific devices, or network of systems, section of the system
		- Servers
		- Legacy Systems
		- IP - Intellectual Property
		- Software Licensing
			- Is what is being used licensed and adhering to legal requirements, compliance? 
	- Process
		- Risk awareness
			- Cybersecurity intelligence sources
		- Evaluate security controls
			- Inherent (current) and residual risk
		- Implement security controls
		- Review periodically
			- Continuous monitoring
	- Risk Types:
		- Environmental 
			- A natural disaster, event, power outages
		- Person-made
			- Riots
			- Terrorism, sabotage etc
		- Internal
			- Malicious insider, malware infections
			- Unaware Users (untrained)
		- External
			- Competitors
			- Other nation states
	- Risk Treatments
		- Mitigation/reduction
			- Security controls are proactively put in place before undertaking the risk
		- Transference/sharing
			- Some of the risk is transferred to another party
				- ie Insurance
		- Avoidance
			- Avoid an activity because it is too risky
		- Acceptance
			- We accept the risk, it falls within the company's risk appetite

- Quantitative Risk Assessments
	- Attaining budget to be able to implement Security Controls can be a difficult task and process
	- In order to better present requirements/solutions/findings we need to:
		- Summarise risk management processes and concepts
			- Is what is being proposed worth doing?
	- Based on numeric values
	- Identifying Asset Value (AV) 
	- Identifying the Exposure Factor (EF)
		- The percentage of AV loss when a negative incident occurs
		- An EF of 1, which means 100%, would mean a complete and total loss of the Asset in question
	- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
		- How much loss is experienced during one negative incident
		- Multiply the AV by the EF
		-  ie 
			- AV = $24,000NZ
				- Say for example how much a Web-system makes on a daily basis, on average
			- What if said Web-system were to go down for three hours in a day for an unexpected reason, due to a particular risk?
				- That would equate to 3/25 = .125 * 100 = 12.5
			- EF = 12.5% (how much loss we'd expect, from a single negative incident)
			- 24000 x 0.125
				- = $3000NZ (SLE)
				- This is how much that downtime would cost, the SLE
		- This is important in Quantitative Risk Assessments
		- Annualised Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
			- Expected n umber of yearly occurrences
				- say, 2-3 times a year
		- Annualised Loss Expectancy (ALE)
			- ALE = SLE x ARO
			- In the example above that would be 3000 x 3 = 9000NZD p/year
		- You then want to compare how much that loss is, compared to how much would be invested/spent on setting up and placing Security Controls into effect
			- So it'd make sense to spend $6000 or less, to protect that Web-system Asset

- Qualitative Risk Assessments
	- Summarise risk management processes and concepts
	- Based on subjective opinion as opposed to hard numbers
		- Threat likelihood
		- Impact of realised threat
		- Severity ratings
	- Depends on who is conducting the Qualitative assessment
	- Risk Register
		- Orgs should have at least one, if not more
		- Centralised list of:
			- Risks
			- Severities
			- Responsibilities
			- Mitigations
	- Usually have a rating system involved
	- Risk Heat Map
		- Allows us to take the severity level for our risks from a Risks Register and put them into a visually compelling type of graph with colour levels can imply the level of risk
			- Red Severe, High
			- Yellow, Medium
			- Green, Low
	- Risk Matrix

- Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
	- Allows us to prioritise Mission Critical Processes
		- Examples
			- Payment processing systems
			- Customer/patient records
				- (Personal Identifiable Information)
	- Assess Risk
		- Identify sensitive data
		- Where is the data that is covered, looked at by compliance/regulatory bodies (law)
		- Identify single points of failure
		- Identify security controls that can be put into place and compliance
	- Examples of impact:
		- Financial
			- Fines
			- Loss of contracts
				- Due to the loss of confidence in the organisation
		- Reputation loss
		- Data loss
			- Breach notification
			- Escalation requirements
				- Law enforcement
				- Government
				- etc
			- Exfiltration
				- Into the hands of unauth'd Users
		- Failed Component Impact
			- MTBF - Mean Time Between Failures
				- Average time between repairable component failures
				- Software patching
			- MTTF - Mean Time To Failure
				- Applies to non-repairable components
				- Drives, switches, routers, motherboard
				- A measure of time until we might expect this kind of failure
			- MTTR - Mean Time To Repair
				- The mean time to repair a component 

	- Locating Critical Resources
		- Where is the data?
		- Data discovery and classification
			- Where is the sensitive data
			- PTA - Privacy Threshold Assessment
				- When you want to understand the nature of the data that you have and the laws and regulations that may apply (compliance)
	- Impact of Sensitive Data
		- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
		- Regulatory compliance
	- RPO - Recovery Point Objective
		- The maximum tolerable amount of data loss
		- Directly related to backup frequency
		- If your RPO is one hour (if we can accommodate for one hour of data loss) then you'd want to ensure that backups are taking place every hour
	- RTO - Recovery Time Objective
		- How much time can we tolerate of downtime of the asset
		-  Return systems and data to usable state within the RTO

	- Data Classification Tools
		- Any method of applying metadata to resources
			- ie cloud resource tagging
				- Storage location 
				- Webapp
				- VMs
		- Then you can classify those resources, via the metadata
		- There should be organisational standards that will outline what the meta-tagging process will be
			- Otherwise people may add metatags left right and centre, doing willy nilly things

		- Processing
		- Sharing
		- Archiving/Deleting
	- Privacy Enhancing Technologies
		- Anonymisation 
			- Removing PII bits away from a collection of data, but retaining some for the sake of statistical purposes
				- so removing names, addresses, etc, that would dox someone fully.
		- Anonymised data has little market value
		- Pseudo-anonymisation
			- Replacing PII with fake identifiers
			- Take for example blood types of people in any particular research being carried out
			- Backgrounds of those people
		- Data minimisation
			- Limit stored/retained sensitive data
		- Tokenisation
			- A digital token authorises access instead of using the original credentials
		- Data Masking
			- Hide sensitive data from unauthorised users
			- ie masking out credit card numbers in transaction receipts
		- Data Sovereignty
		- Where is the data located?  Physically.
			- WHERE?!
