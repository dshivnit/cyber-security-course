- Going through Star Trek stuff
- Going through feedback regarding the course, potential courses, and other bits and pieces related to course members
- Going through Docker continuing from last week 
---
- Docker
	- V8 module
		- Networking
		- File System operations
	- The above was then called nodejs
	- npmjs.org
		- node_modules
	- node.js connects to npmjs.org as its package repository 
- Docker File is used to build an image
- An image is immutable (meaning it can not be changed)
- Container
	- A running image
	- -ports
	- -volumes
	- Containers are ephemeral 
		- Like sand on a beach, gone with a gust of wind
	- Containers are based off images
	- Treat containers like you would treat a cloud - they disappear!
- Going through https://github.com/docker/welcome-to-docker
- Recap
	- Commands from the directory where a dockerfile.txt sits (which already has the FROM base-image line in it)
	- `docker build -f dockerfile.txt -t nodedeleteme`
	- RUN commands inside the dockerfile, run while the build of the image is happening
	- RUN is used for the docker image itself
	- `docker exec -it 'hash-of-a-container' sh`
		- Will get a shell connection to the container
	- The more RUN commands you have, the more layers you have in your version
	- Usually a design would be to have commands that take a long time to run to run first, and then commands/operations that would take less time to run after

	- https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker_cheatsheet.pdf
	- Dockerfile > Build image > Run image > creates a container (which is a running image) > shell'd into the container using `exec` command
- By default a Docker Container do not expose its ports and volumes
- It is the host (that is hosting the Docker Container) that specifies what ports and volumes can be exposed
- 
- Image
	- Containers are based off images
- Multiple images for multiple versions of an application
- Files
	- package-lock.json
		- Names of packages that are depended upon 
		- and the version along with hashes
		- 
	- package.json
	- the above use react.js 
		- Allows to do dynamic web page updates 
- Dive - in relation to Docker Containers
- Queues - Rabbit MQueue
- Jenkins
	- Written in Java
	- Continuous Integration
- Secrets can be passed into a container when running the container with the `-e` parameter (example: `-e NAME=whatever`)
	- Will create a NAME variable with value whatever when the container is created
	- backslash characters when running a command in Docker file `\` to cancel the new line character (if you want to put commands on seperate lines
	- ie 
	- `RUN chmod +x net-data-installer.sh && \
	- `cp -rp /deps/* /usr/local/ && \
	- `'another line of commands'`

People:
- Feistel
	- Partially responsible for the DES encryption standard
- Rob Pike
	- Worked on something called Plan9 and one of the developers of the GO language
- Dijkstra
	- Dutch computer scientist
	- Graph Traversal
	-

Terminologies and Stuff:
- Electron App
	- Javacript library that allows you to create desktop applications using web technologies
	- Functionality, amongst other things
- Noscript tag
	- `<noscript>Please enable Javascript to run this app or to view this content</noscript>`
- Full stack developer
	- Will know both back and front end systems
	- Python and Javascript
	- Some backend language along with a front-end language, (like Javascript)
	- If you're using node.js (which is Javascript in the back-end as well) -- then you're a fullstack developer!
- UX User Experience
- UI - Front-end coding
- const - immutable
- let or var - mutable
- jsx

ToDo:
- js, nodejs, react > do a crash course somewhere
- Go through other Dockerfile's and have a look around
- https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker_cheatsheet.pdf
- Github
	- Find respositories that have Dockerfiles
	- Check the Dockerfiles
	- Download the repo's
	-
