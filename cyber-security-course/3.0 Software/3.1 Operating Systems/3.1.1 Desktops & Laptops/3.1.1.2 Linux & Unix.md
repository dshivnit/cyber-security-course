Tux! :) 
*Commands currently are in the Commands Page - may be revised when I go through all this material later...*

- SSH is normally used to connect to a remote Linux box's Terminal
- Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol/connection between two devices in an encrypted form
- - starting commands with `' '` to avoid history

- who
	- print information about users who are currently logged in 
	- -a 
- uname -a
	- printing out Linux system version
- ps aux
	- shows running processes on the machine 
- PATH:
	  - In Shell:
		  "echo $PATH"
- Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard

- $SHELL
	- /bin/zsh 
		- will change to the zsh shell if you have it in /bin/
	- $SHELL --version 
		- will display what shell you are running and it's details
- Permissions
	- Owner
	- User
		- Root
			- UID = 0 (if a User does not have a UID of 0, then that User is not root)
				- uid -u *username*
		- id 
	- Others
	- `chmod`
		- r
			- 4
		- w
			- 2
		- x
			- 1
		- rwx
			- 7
		- rw
			- 6
		- rx
			- 5
		- wx
			- 3
		- `chmod 777`
			- don't lul
	- A better way to explain these settings are like this:
		- 4 = Read
		- 2 = Write
		- 1 = Execute
	- Add them up in any combination to be able to get the setting you want for either User, Group or Others
- SUID/GUID Files
	- Set User ID
	- Set Group ID
	- These types of files can be run with the permissions that the owner/group has. 
	- `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
	- `find / -perm u=g -type f 2>/dev/null`
- SUID Binary
	- 
- rot13 example (with tr)
	- `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' <<< `*string that has to be rotated*
- `xxd`
	- Make a hexdump or reverse one
	- Check the options
- `dff` (NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THIS COMMAND BECAUSE WTF ..)
	- Compare files line by line
- `cut`
	- `ls -al | cut -d " " -f 1`
- `awk`
	- Similar to `cut`
	- `awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd`
- `sed`
	- Stream editor
	- `echo "hello this is a test" | sed -e 's/hello/blah/'`
	- `cat /etc/passwd | sed -e 's/:/____/g'`
- `history`
- `echo $HISTFILE`
- `vim $HISTFILE`

- If you need to add something to PATH after trying to run it and the system advising that it isn't a part of the PATH, run this - well this is adding the .local/bin directory to the PATH if it wasn't there (most of the User installed services will live there as opposed to the bin directory in root) (sorry if the notes here are a bit wonky - will fix this later)
	- `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
- And then load the shell rc file
	- `source ~\.zshrc` (or whatever shell rc file you may that is relevant)
- this will export the PWD to PATH
	- `export PATH="$(pwd):$PATH"`
- `which command_name`
	- Will print out where the 'command_name' lives in the system
	- 

- Directories
	- Common
		- /etc
			- Commonplace to store system files that are used by the OS
		- /var
			- Stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system
				- Log Files (/var/log)
		- /root
			- Home for the root user
		- /tmp
			- Used to store data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice
			- Similar to RAM
				- once the system restarts or is shutdown, tmp is CLEARED :) 
		- ~/.config/ 
			- Location of installed packages that the related User has installed
		- /etc/skel
			- Is the directory used by useradd to create the default settings in a new user's home directory
			- To change the location of /etc/skel, edit /etc/default/useradd
		- /etc/shadow
			- A file 
			- Contains encrypted User passwords and is accessible only to the root user
		- /etc/passwd
			- File
			- Text-baed database of informationa bout users that may log into the system or other OS User identities that own running processes
		- /dev/
			- Contains virtual devices
			- Contains stderr, stdin, stdout
			- /dev/stderr
				- Will display on the screen
			- /dev/stdin
				- Keyboard input
				- Normally linked out to another file/location
					- ie /proc/self/fd/0
			- /dev/stdout
				- Will display on the screen or wherever the default link is pointing to in dev/stderr
				- 2 > stderr
			- /dev/random
				- Fake device which generates random data (REAL FAST!)
				- Running this randomly in terminal:
					- `</dev/random > tmp.file`
						- Make sure you `ctrl+c` this pretty quickly because it starts soaking up data, real fast.
					- 
			- /dev/zero
				- Even faster than random
			- /dev/mem
				- An image of the main memory of the computer (RAM)
			- /dev/mapper
				- Logical volumes
				- Virtual block devices carved out of storage space
			- /dev/null
				- The rubbish bin
				- It will discard anything that is written to it
					- And will as a result return an EOF on reading
		- /proc/
			- A virtual directory that contains information around the various processes that are running on the computer
			- PIDs will be shown here that have their own elements to each one
			- /proc/cpuinfo
				- Speaks for itself
			- /proc/vmstat
				- 
			- /proc/meminfo
				- Information around the state and details of physical memory on the system
		- /etc/systemd/system
			- 

- Python3's HTTP server on the fly
	- To be able to serve files
	- Called "HTTPServer" 
	- From which you would be able to use curl and/or wget commands from the receiving end to pull files from your machine/web_server
	- python3 -m http.server
		- Simply starts a on the fly web server (no need for Apache etc :) ) 

- Updog
	- Another webserver, more lightweight than Python3's variant above
	- https://github.com/sc0tfree/updog
	- Can set adhoc SSL certs and use basic auth over HTTP

- Backgrounding and Foregrounding Processes
	- **LOOK INTO THIS AND DETAIL FURTHER WITH SOME PRAC CUZ PLEB

- Automation
	- Task scheduling
		- Running commands
		- Backing up files
		- Launching programs
		- etc
	- cron
		- crontab
			- Started during boot
			- Responsible for facilitating and managing cron jobs
			- A file with formatting that is recognised by the cron process to execute each line ste-by-step (like a script :) ) 
			- crontabs require six specific values:
				- min - which minute to execute
				- hour - which hour to execute
				- dom - which day of the month
				- mon - which month
				- dow - day of the week
				- cmd - the actual command to run
			- use of the wildcard * is a thang, thing
			- crontabs can be modified by:
				- crontab -e
					- (using your default text editor)

- Package Management
	- When developers submit software to the community they submit it to an 'apt' repository
	- IF approved, that program will be released into the wild
	- Merits
		- User accessibilty
		- Open Source tools
	- /etc/apt
		- these files serve as the gateway/registry to the package manager/repos
	- You can also add your own community repos to your list
		- add-apt-respository
		- or by listing another provider
	- Managing Repositories
		- Package Management Software
			- apt
		- The integrity of what we download is guaranteed by the use of what is called GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys
			- A safety check from developers saying, "this is ours" 
			- If keys don't match up to what your system trust and what the devs used, then the software won't be downloaded

- System Logs
	- /var/log
	- rotating
		- OS automatically managing these logs
	- These logs normally will detail every single action or event that has taken place from a service that is running on the machine
	- access log
	- error log

- /etc/passwd
	- plain text file
	- Holds a list of the system's accounts
		- User ID, Group ID, Home Directory, Shell, and more
	- Will have general read permission for all as many command utilities use it to map User IDs to unames
	- However `write` should only be for root
		- If however this has been overlooked, then there is a vulnerability wherein a root user can be created, one which a threat actor can access.
	- Format:
		- `uname:x:0:0:/home/uname:/bin/zsh`
		- Username
			- Between 1 and 32 characters
		- Password
			- `x`
			- x will indicate that an encrypted password is stored in the /etc/shadow file
			- Note that you will need to use the passwd command to compute the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of a password in the shadow file
			-  Creating a password hash
				- `openssl passwd -1 -salt 'saltValue' 'password'`
		- UID
			- User ID
			- 0 is reserved for root
			- UIDs from 1-99 are reserved for predefined accounts
			- 100-999 are reserved by the system for admin and system accounts/groups
		- GID
			- Primary group ID
			- Stored in /etc/group
		- User ID Info
			- Comment field
			- Details can be stored here such as name, phone number etc
			- Used by the  `finger` command
		- Home Directory
			- Path to the user's home directory
			- if this doesn't exist then the system will default to `/`
		- Command Shell
			- ie `/bin/zsh` or whatever

- Cron Jobs
	- See what's scheduled
		- `cat /etc/crontab`

- PATH Variable
	- `echo $PATH`
	- Specifies directories that hold executable programs. 
	- When the user runs any command in the terminal, it searches for executable files with the help of the PATH variable responding to commands made by the user
	- Pushing a directory to PATH
		- `export PATH=/'dir':$PATH`
		- Willa dd the given directory to PATH
