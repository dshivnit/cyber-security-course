- Docker / Containers
	- Main use-case is for Software Distribution
		- CI/CD
		- Staged rollouts of new versions of applications
		- Like lightweight virtual machines
		- Distribution of programs more redistributable
		- What works for me, should work for you essentially
		- Docker Image is like a zip file
		- Docker container is the running program itself
		- Docker volume, is a shared drive between the container and your system
		- Docker build command looks for a file called a Dockerfile with some configurations in it
		- Needing to specify ports to use
	- Docker - came from FreeBSD
	- Came from the idea of the jail and chroot directories (mentioned further below) 
	- VMs have virtual hardware
	- Containers and jails, chroots - you don't have virtual hardware, it's like a zip file where its contents can't escape
	- Containers, Jails, Chroots use the system resources from which it sits on top of
	- Dockers can be run on system startup via scripts
	- Initially had numerous vulnerabilities
		- Container escape vulns
			- Where people figured out how to break out of the container and access the root/outside system containing/housing the container
	- In Windows, Dockers would run under WSL v2.0
	- ECS
		- Elastic Container Service
	- EKS
		- Elastic Kubernetes Service
	- Installing Docker on both Win and Linux machines
	- Containers can be run, with the files, programs within - to be runnable on any machine
	- Containers
		- Running file
		- Composable
			- Meaning you take versions of containers and then build from them
			- DockerFile
				- File named Dockerfile
				- FROM imagename:tag
				- opening cmd
				- `docker build . -t tag_name`
					- will build a docker image from the Dockerfile config 
						- Example in the config file named `Dockerfile` 
							- `FROM python:latest`
				- if the base image is deleted from the system
					- Then the Dockerfile that has based it's image from the base image will need to redownload and run that base image
				- 
			- `docker`
				- Shows commands that can be run
			- .dockerignore
				- Will ignore contents of said file
				- secrets
			- `docker ps `
				- Will show running docker containers
			- `docker run -p outerport:innerport image:tag`
			- 
	- Images
		- Like a zip file
		- Optional Settings
			- Container Name
			- Ports
			- Volumes
			- Environment Variables
	- Volumes
		- Drives that can be accessed from outside the container
	- Builds
	- Docker Scout
	- Extensions
	- Docker Hub
		- Like GitHub
		- But for Docker Images
		- Official repository
		- Pull
			- Will download the image to your computer
		- Run
			- Will pull and run the image
	- Installed nginx
		- configured a randomly generated port pointing to 80
		- looking at localhost:randomport
	- When installing images
		- Make sure to take note of the version you want to keep in check - as automatic updates to the images/software (with the latest option) may break your program

Terminologies and Stuff:
- Berkley had created a fork from the Unix distro
- Berkley Software Distribution
	- FreeBSD
		- Designed to be run as functional as possible
		- Had a lot of different software that could be run on it
		- Had a security team 
			- Colin Percival
		- Had a type of security boundary called jails
			- Jails - a single directory where you could put stuff into it, like a program, and other files, when a program within it runs it would think that the mail directory would be the entire system as such
				- Like the program was locked inside a jail
			- Linux had a version of it
				- chroot
	- NetBSD
		- Designed to be run on any device at all
			- A coffee machine!
		- Super lightweight
	- OpenBSD
		- No security vulnerabilities in it philosophy
		- By not having any services available on it by default
			- but SSH
		- Then SSH had a vuln in it back in around 2004
	- DragonflyBSD
- Each one has different philosophies behind why people use them
- Monolithic OSes
- Microkernel
- look out for .env files
	- They could hold secrets
	- .dockerignore
	- .gitignore
