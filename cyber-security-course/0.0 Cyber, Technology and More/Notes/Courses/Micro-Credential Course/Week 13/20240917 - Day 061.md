- Git
	- Going through practical runs with git commands in CLI
- 
- Docker
- MS Azure Labs

- Git
	- `git init`
		- will create a .git folder
		- Just a regular directory that contain the history of all changes made in the git repository
		- All the commits
		- .git is the repository
	- `git help`
	- `git clone`
	- `git commit`
	- `git log`
	- `git status`
	- `git add`
		- Will add a file to be tracked in the repository and version control
	- `git diff`
		- Shows what's changed in a files that are being tracked
		- 
	- tracked, untracked, staged, committed, changed+tracked but uncommited
	- Untracked files
		- are not tracked by version control at all
		- Any changes made to these files will not be tracked
	- Staged
		- Limbo between uncommitted and committed
	- DON'T get into the habit of pushing one massive commit over extensive periods of time
		- Without checking
		- Especially when working in a collaborative team
		- As team members may then have to retract work committed due to issues that have arisen (in the event that issues have arisen)
- COMMIT OFTEN, and COMMIT SMALL REVISIONS AT A TIME
- Branches of a repository, so that developers could work on separate bits of the code > essentially delegated parts of the project/repository to individual teams 
	- Merging changes into a main repository tree, one would need to pull the main repository at it's current version > fix any bugs > then re-merge, update the main version
- Merge Conflicts
	- Issues that arise when multiple teams are working on the same code and have to revise what other teams have worked on to get their scope of work is to work
- Merge the changes carefully when working with different branches of a main repository
- Each commit has a hash associated with it
	- And a TAG can be added as well - a name, or an alias
	- Tags help humans to remember it, as opposed to having to remember the hashes
	- Say, v1.0, v1.0.1
- Forks
	- A function of GitHub
	- A way of taking an entire repository and copying it
	- A clone
- A container is kind of like a fake VM
- - CTFs
	- A `.git` directory being a part of a container
	- Go through it and look through the commits
	- API keys
	- Flags
	- PUT THE .git in the .dockerignore FILE!
	- or
		- Instead of `COPY . . `
			- Instead, copy the invidiual items/dirs/files that you need to inside the container
		- From the local machine working directory, specify exactly what it is you want, don't just put a dot `.` for everything
	- Update the container with new code, additions and test it
		- If it works, then roll it to the image
			- as a new version
		- Keep in mind that containers do get blown away, with the wind ;) 
- Docker
	- Volumes
		- `docker volume create my-vol`
		- https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/#:~:text=Volumes%20are%20stored%20in%20a,anywhere%20on%20the%20host%20system.
		- 
	- Compose
- `COPY . .`
	- Copy the contents of the current working directory into the working directory of the image/container
---
- `docker exec -it 'hash-of-container' sh`
- Imagine numerous containers running of the same image serving for a web server
- If a container fails for whatever reason - just launch another one

Terminologies and the Etc's
- Other versioning systems
	- Subversion
		- A versioning system similar to git
			- But shit
		- Each developer didn't keep a copy of the whole code on their system
		- You basically worked on what you were working on 
		- If the subversion server would have gone down, everyone loses everything
		- 
	- VCS
	- DVCS
		- Distributed Version Control Systems
	- Git
	- Mecurial
- DefCon
	- Arguably the best conference
	- Good to go through content/talks covered there
- Using Docker to try out various applications without having to worry about their dependencies
- CUDA
	- Intermediary programming language that allows you to read into GPUs
- Port 7860
	- Default port for Python Gradio
	- Recognisable distinct UI (Gradio)
