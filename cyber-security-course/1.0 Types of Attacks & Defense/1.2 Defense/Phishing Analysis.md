- Email Body Analysis
	- Links can be manually extracted (either directly from the email itself - 'copy link location', or by going through the raw email header for example)
	- Or perhaps use a tool
		- https://www.convertcsv.com/url-extractor.htm
		- Put the raw email header in
		- Extract the URLs
	- CyberChef has a "Extract URLs" tool within it as well
	- Important to note the root domain for the extracted URLs
	- Check reputation of found URLs and their root domains (use some of the tools above)
	- IF there are any attachments - obtain it safely.
		- Save it, don't open it.
		- Grab the hash of the acquired attachment and check VirusTotal or similar tools to see if there have been any reports against it
