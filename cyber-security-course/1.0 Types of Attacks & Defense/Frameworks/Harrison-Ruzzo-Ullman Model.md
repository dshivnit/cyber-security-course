- A computer security model that analyses and describes access control policies. 
- Used to ensure the safety and security of information systems
- Uses six primitive operations to manipulate access rights, such as creating and destroying objects and subjects, and entering and deleting rights
- Analyses how these operations may lead to unauthorised access
- Examines the relationships between subjects and objects to prevent safety property violations

Need to expand further on this model.
