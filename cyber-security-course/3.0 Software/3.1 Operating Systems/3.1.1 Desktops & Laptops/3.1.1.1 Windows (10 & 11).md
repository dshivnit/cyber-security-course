- GUI

		- Display Settings

		- (Or System Tray)
- File System
	- NTFS
		- New Technology File System 
		- Before NTFS
			- Fat16/Fat32 (File Allocation Table)
			- HPFS (High Performance File System)
			- FAT in use in USB devices, MicroSD cards etc
		- Known as a journaling file system
		- In thee event of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on the disk using information stored in a log file
			- This functionality is not available on FAT file systems
		- Addresses many issues that the FAT filesystem had:
			- Supports files larger than 4GB
			- Set permissions for specific folders and/or files
			- Folder and file compression
			- Encryption (EFS or Encryption File System)
		- Permissions *( needing to describe the chmod function in Linux)*
			- Full Control
				- Folder / File = what do you think
			- Modify
				- Folder
					- Permits reading, writing, of files and subfolders, allows the deletion of the folder
				- File
					- Permits reading/writing of file, deletion of the file
			- Read & Execute
				- Folders
					- Viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well of executing of files (inherited by files and folders)
				- Files
					- Viewing and accessing of a files contents, executing of a file
			- List Folder Contents
				- Folders
					- Viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well as executing of files, inhered by folders only
				- Files
					- Bruh
			- Read
				- Folders
					- Viewing and listing of files and subfolders
				- Files
					- Permits viewing or accessing of the files contents
			- Write
				- Folders
					- Permits adding of files and subfolders
				- Files
					- Permits writing to a file
		- **ADS**
			- Alternate Data Streams
			- File attribute specific to NTFS
			- Every file has at lease one data stream ($DATA) 
				- The contents of a .txt file
				- Executable code in a .exe file
				- Also referred to as the "unnamed data stream"
			- ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data
			- Natively, WinExplorer doesn't display ADS to the User
			- There are third party exe's that can be used to view this data
			- Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files
			- An ADS must be named
				- Note that $DATA for the file will remain unchanged if there are ADS's added
			- Add a colon at the end of the file name and extension along with the name of the ADS
				- example: test.txt:stream2
			- MACs make use of two streams per file
				- One for data
				- One for resource information
			- Since NTFS supports multiple streams, a MAC file could be copied on to a Windows Server and back again without losing the resource stream
			- Archive Management and Backup Software use ADS to store file revision information
			- Web Browsers add a stream to files downloaded from the Internet that includes security information about where the file came from
			- Adversaries can misuse ADS for malicious purposes such as malware attacks
				- Similar to a unknown compartment in a suitcase used by a smuggler to smuggle something across borders or by inspection officers
			- ADS can be used to hide code and execute future attacks while skirting basic sec utility detection 
			- ADS can store any type of file, audio, video, images, code
			- ADS are hidden, users wouldn't be able to detect them when using directory indexing or listing commands
			- Tools to gain visibility of ADS
				- Echo and More
				- Sysinternals Streams utility
				- /R option of dir in command-line
				- PowerShell 3.0
					- has six cmdlets to directly manipulate content for ADS
- Windows and System32 Folders

	- Make sure you aren't stupid and disable the local default administrator account
	- AFTER you create an additional, different named, local admin account ;) 
	- Then, your main account, ensure it isn't in the Administrators Group
	- Simple, and basic. Do it if you're reading this and haven't done so already
	- Same goes for your Linux builds, any builds. (You do not want the main account you'll be playing with/in to be an admin, period.)
	- :) 
	- User Access Control
		- Elevated permissions required to install applications or run system tasks/programs
- Control Panel
	- Please don't go away...
	- Ongoing changes being made to this what seems to be going to be extinct feature in Windows

	- Drive encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and address the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.
	- Provides the most protection when used with a TPM v1.2 or later.
	- If a device doesn't have TPM 1.2 or later, then a USB Startup Key would be needed
- VSS - Volume Shadow Copy Service
	- Coordinates the required actions to create a consistent shadow copy (a snapshot) of the data to be backed up
	- Stored in the System Volume Information folder on each drive that has the protection enabled
		- Create a restore point
		- Perform system restore
		- Configure restore settings
		- Delete restore points
	- From a security perspective - malware writers know of this Windows feature and write code in their malware to look for these files and delete them. 
		- Doing so makes it impossible to recover from a ransomware attack unless you have an offline/off-site backup.
