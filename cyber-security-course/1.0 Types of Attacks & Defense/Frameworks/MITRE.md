"At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centres, and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation"

US-based, non-profit

- Alongside CVEs, MITRE researches into other areas, outside of Cybersecurity, some:
	- Artificial Intelligence
	- Health Informatics
	- Space Security
	- and much more
- For the Cybersecurity Community:
	- ATT&CK 
		- (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge)
	- CAR
		- (Cyber Analytics Repository)
		- This is a knowledge base
	- ENGAGE
		- (no acronym! doh!)
	- D3FEND
		- (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
	- AEP
		- (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)

- APT - Advanced Persistent Threat
	- Considered a team/group (threat group) or a country (nation-state group), that engages in long-term attacks against organisations and/or other countries
- TTP
	- Tactics, Techniques, Procedures

MITREs ATT&CK Framework
- https://attack.mitre.org/
- Globally available knowledge base of tactics and techniques on real-world observations
- Documents TTPs and APTs

MITREs ENGAGE Framework
- for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations
- Categories:
	- Prepare
		- set of operational actions that will lead to your desired outcome (input)
			- Plan
	- Expose
		- adversaries when they trigger your deployed deception activities
			- Collect
			- Detect
	- Affect
		- Adversaries by performing actions that will have a negative impact on their operations
			- Prevent
			- Direct
			- Disrupt
	- Elicit
		- Information by observing the adversary and learn more about their modus operandi (TTPs)
			- Reassure
			- Motivate
	- Understand
		- The outcomes of the operational actions (output)
			- Analyse

Threat Model
- A risk assessment that models organisational strengths and weaknesses

MITRE D3FEND
- https://d3fend.mitre.org/
- A knowledge graph of Cybersecurity counter-measures
- Funded by the Cybersecurity Directorate of the NSA
- Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense

MITRE ENGENUITY
- https://mitre-engenuity.org/
- CTID
	- https://ctid.mitre.org/
	- Centre of Threat-Informed Defense
	- Consists of various companies and vendors from around the planet
	- Objective is to conduct research on cyber threats and their TTPs and share this research to improve cyber defense for all
	- Some companies and vendors:
		- AttackIQ (founder)
		- Verizon
		- Microsoft (founder)
		- Red Canary (founder)
		- Splunk
- Adversary Emulation Library and ATT&CK Emulation Plans
	- https://medium.com/mitre-engenuity/introducing-the-all-new-adversary-emulation-plan-library-234b1d543f6b
	- The Adversary Emulation library is a public library making adversary emulation plans a free resource for blue/red teamers
	- Contribution from CTID
	- Emulators are a step-by-step guide to mimic the specific threat group
		- "How would we handle an attack from APT ### and so on"

Threat Intelligence (TI) and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)
- The information and TTPs attributed to an APT
- We can make better decisions regarding the defensive strategy via the use of TI
- The goal of threat intelligence is to make the information actionable
