- AWS had come out with something called Cloud Formation
	- Language that you can only apply to AWS
	- JSON format
		- Can be preferrable as other systems can extract from JSON format relatively easily
	- YAML format
	- EC2
		- Elastic Compute Cloud
		- Provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud
	- SecurityGroup (for AWS) relates to a virtual firewall for EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic
	- T2 VMs
		- nano
		- micro
		- small
		- medium
		- large
		- xlarge
		- 2xlarge
	- 
- Hashicorp - Terraform
	- https://www.terraform.io/
	- Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their APIs. Providers enable Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API
		- AWS
		- Azure
		- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
		- Kubernetes
		- Helm
		- GitHub
		- Splunk
		- DataDog
		- and more
	- Three stages:
		- Write the code
			- IAC - Infrastructure as Code
			- Define resources, which may be across multiple cloud providers and services. 
			- ie you may create a config to dploy an application on VMs in a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network with security groups and a load balancer
		- Plan 
			- Create an execution plan
			- Describing the infrastructure it will create, update, or destroy based on the existing infrastructure and your configuration
		- Apply
			- On approval, Terraform performs the proposed operations in the correct order respecting any resource dependencies
				- ie - if you update the properties of a VPC and change the number of VMs in that VPC, Terraform will recreate the VPC before scaling the VMs

Terminologies and Random Stuff:
- DMARC - Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance
	- A standard that prevents spammers from using your domain to send email without your permission
- Lambda Functions
	- Similar to user-defined functions, but without a name
	- Commonly referred to as anonymous functions
	- Efficient whenever you want to create a function that will only contain simple expressions
		- Expressions that are usually a single line of a statement
- Docker
	- Lets you build, test and deploy applications quickly
- Terraform
	- Infrastructurous code
	- You write scripts to define how you want your architecture to be
	- Has your cloud API keys loaded into it
	- It will then go through, speak with the cloud APIs and build the architecture based on the scripts you have written
	- Used by DevOps
	- Kind of vendor agnostic
	- An infrastructure as code tool that enables you to safely and predictably provision and manage infrastructure in any cloud
	- Hashicorp
		- Misho Hashimoto - likes to create tools
		- One tool, "Vagrant," allowed you to make a config file, called a vagrant file, a text file pretty much, in the text file you define which OS you want to use, it would then connect to his servers and download a VM - performance issues can be had
	- Spicy controversy recently - licensing changes, to make more money out of the Terraform service
	- Terraform was then forked to provide an alternative
- IAC - Infrastructure as Code
- Configuration Management Software
	- Before Terraform was a big thing
	- Where the DevOps name comes from
	- In the late 2000s, early 2010s
		- Developers were wanting to get things done, and they would ask out to the Ops Team, IT Teams, to request for access to resources, computers, to install applications etc
			- This request would then have to go through a formal request for acceptance
		- Developers were then looking into ways to get around this
		- Cloud was also becoming more prominent at this time
		- Hardware virtualisation was also becoming more prominent
		- So hardware would be able to run VMs that would have better performance to legacy VMs as these were hardware enabled
		- The ability to talk directly to the hardware
			- In the past it would have to run through an emulation layer
		- Hardware virtualisation came along, it allowed VMs to speak with the hardware to result in better performance
	- You could ask a Cloud Provider for specific specs on a VM
		- You could then dedicate some of the hardware on this VM to other specific VMs
			- That could be dedicated for clients say for example
	- DevOps became a thing
		- Developers plus Operations
	- Pulumi
		- IAC (Infrsatructure As Code)
		- https://www.pulumi.com/
		- Can create code project in a preferred programming language
		- 
	- Toolings:
		- Chef
		- Puppet
		- Ansible
		- SaltStack
		- These have been going out of trend in recent years, due to them requiring too much involvement in the nitty gritty of the details
		- Act as a layer above SSH 
		- You run the command, set up the config file - it then SSH's out to a bunch of different computers and runs APT-UPDATE, and installs software and other items for you depending on what the config file details
		- Provides consistency and automation

	- Ansible Playbook
		- Ansible's term for config files
		- Written in Python and PowerShell
	- 
- Hypervisor 
	- Allows your computer to run multiple OSes
	- A low-level, lightweight version of Linux
- YAML
	- Yet-Another Markup Language
	- Human-readable data serialisation language - commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data are being stored or transmitted
- TOML
	- Tom's Obvious Minimal Language
- DOCKER
	- Software platform that allows you to build, test and deploy applications quickly
	- Docker is an OS for containers, similar to how VM virtrualises (removes the need to directly manage) server hardware, containers virtualise the OS of a server
	- Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands you can use to build, start or stop containers
	- AWS Services like AWS Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Batch make it easy to run and manage Docker containers at scale
	- Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. 
	- The isolation and security lets you run many containers simultaneously on a given host. 
	- Containers are lightweight, and contain everything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely what's installed on the host. 
	- You can share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way. 
- .ini files
	- Configuration file
	- Didn't support nested or structured data
- LAMP
	- Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl
- Spec Work
	- Speculative Work
		- Is any kind of creative work that has been completed or submitted by volunteer designers to prospective clients, under the circumstances that a fair or reasonable fee has not been agreed upon in writing. 
- Configuration Files and Scripts (such as stated above) could very well be replaced by AI moving forward in the not too distant future
- Typescript
	- Similar to Javascript
	- Makes you declare variables a bit differently
	- Object-oriented language
		- Javascript is a prototype-based language
- Seeing IAC in the future as a way to be able to automate configurations regardless of which Service is being used (ie MS Azure, AWS, GCP - Google Cloud Platform, and the others; listed above)
- Fermi Calculation
	- Back of the envelope type calculation

ToDo:
- AWS Cloud Formation
- Keep a register of tools/skills known in comparison with what is common-place in the market today
	- Update it 
- Look up static websites code for Pulumi
	- (and others)
- Have a look at all the AWS products, comparison between Azure, GCP and any others you consider that would be important to consider
	- But also, keep in mind, don't fall into just one line.
