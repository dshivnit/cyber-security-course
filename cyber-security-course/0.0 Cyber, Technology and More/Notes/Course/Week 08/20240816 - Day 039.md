- Counting in Binary
- Overflow
	- n bits - 2^n possible states 
	- Buffers reset when reached
	- If you don't have enough bits to represent the numbers you want to represent > then you have an overflow
	- Representation of binary numbers
		- Unsigned Integers
			- No plus or minus sign
		- Signed Integers
			- plus and minus
			- You have a limited number of bits to represent these numbers
			- The most left hand bit will indicate whether the number is positive or a negative number
				- One's complement
- Segmentation violation:
	- When a program requests to read parts that it isn't allowed to from physical memory
- Initialising memory
	- Setting data to variables, like an array
- 
- Covered some C with buffer overflow examples
	- The honey badger of languages
	- Identifiers
		- %p 
			- pointer reference to where a variable would be sitting in physical memory
		- %c
			- Character
		- %u
			- unsigned integer
		- %s
			- string
		- %X
			- Hexadecimal
- ASLR - Address Space Layout Randomisation
	- Which moves references to where data is held in RAM, physical memory, to various locations in random access memory
	- In relation to virtual-memory

- Python
	- import hashlib

Terminologies and Stuff:
- Power Sources / Storage / Random Stuff:
	- Topomac and Liquid reactors
		- Links saved from the Team - will check this later
	- Fusion
	- Scalability of various power sources
		- There is also the video that one of us shared - check that too
	- The storage of stored power
	- Signed Variables
		- Variables holds a value that is either positive or negative using it's most significant bit (the last bit to the left --- which is called the signed bit)
	- Unsigned variable does not
		- But instead the most significant bit is just the power of two 
- Hooking
	- In software - manipulating an existing process/software that is running by getting into memory that it would be utilising
	- Took hook into something
		- A range of techniques to alter or augment the behaviour of an operating system, or applications, or other software components by intercepting function calls, or messages or events passed between those software components
- Link Rot
	- Pretty much speaks for itself
- FIPS
	- Federal Information Processing Standard

Todo:
- Signed and unsigned variables
- One's complement
- Two's complement
- Read up on ASLR further and its relationship with Virtual Memory
- RTFM
- Grey/Black Hat Python
- Always consider the date/version of when the book was released
- SPACEBALLS !!! rewatch this
- Simplewall for FIREWALL!
