Topics: 
- - Steganography
	- Practice of concealing information within another message or physical object to avoid detection. 
	- Can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, including text, image, video or audio content. 
	- The hidden data is then extracted at its destination
- Race condition 
	- Related to programming
	- Occur when two computer program processes, or threads, attempt to access the same resource at the same time and cause problems in the system. Common issue in multithreaded applications and concurrent programming.
- Threading 
	- Execution of the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler. 
	- It is a sequence of instructions given to the CPU by a program or application. 
- Netcat
	- A computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. 
	- The command is designed to be a dependable back-end that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.
- XIFF format
	- Exchangeable Image File
	- Standard that specifies formats for images, sound and ancillary tags used by digital cameras, scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. 
- Email headers
	- A hidden snippet of code in an email that contains detailed information about the sender, the recipient and how the  message was routed and authenticated.
- MX records
	- Mail Exchange record
	- Identifies the mail servers being used by the Domain Namethat is in question
- SPF Records
	- Sender Policy Framework
	- Email authentication method which ensures the sending mail server is authorised to originate mail from the email sender's domain. 
	- This authentication only applies to the email sender listed in the "envelope from" field during the initial SMTP connectiion
- DMARC
	- Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance
	- Email security protocol
	- Verifies email senders by buildin gon the DNS, DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
- DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)
	- The DKIM signature enables domain authentication to validate that the message was legitimately sent from the specified domain
- Email blocklists
- TCP / UDP
- Ports
- Modular Arithmetic 
	- A system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. 
	- The modern approach was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (published in 1801)
- Hashing Checksums 
- Data Integrity 
- Storage: bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2 Salts
- Bcrypt
	- password-hashing function 
	- Based on the Blowfish cipher
- Scrypt
	- Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function
	- Specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory
- Argon2
	- A key derivation function 
	- Password-hashing function that summarizes the state of the art in the design of memory-hard functions and can be used to hash passwords for credential storage, key derivation or other applications
- PBKDF2
	- Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2
	- Make it more difficult for an attacker to crack a password, even if they possess the hashed password value
	- Define which hashing algo you want to use, and then, how many times you want to use it
- Cryptography Salts
	- Made up of random bits added to each password instance before its hashing
	- Salts create unique passwords even in the instance of two users choosing the same password
	- Help mitigate hash table attacks by forcing attackers to re-compute them using the salts for each user
	- Extra bit of randomness that is stored in the DB containing the hashed password (salt)
	- Added after the password has been supplied (ie pass123, then the salt is applied after to create the hash and is stored in the DB)
	- *Look into this more*

TODO: 
- Cryptohack > sign up for it and do as many challenges as you can
		Done, for now.
		
- Morse Code
	- The Morse Code is a language that people used to use to communicate with each other
	- Uses a series of short and long bursts that are heard, or seen
	- Dit
		- Short bursts
	- Dah
		- Long bursts
	- Named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy
	- Can be transmitted along a telegraph wire
	- Also can be transmitted to an audio tone, a radio signal with short and long tones (or high and low tones) 
	- Or can be transmitted as a mechanical, audible, or visual signal (like a light)

- OSINT | Exif Tool (https://exif.osint-tool.com/)
	- A tool that allows for viewing hidden metadata in your images
	- Details like 
		- geolocation
		- Camera settings
		- Image Properties
		- And others
		  
- picoctf
	- Online CTF platform allowing for creative learning
	
- Bash scripting basics
	  added to todos
	  
- Connecting via SSH
	  I use Putty for this, or have in the past
	  Can also use CLI (normally installed by default, just have to make sure the other end has their service and sometimes a client running as well)


TODO Continued:
- Modular arithmetic basics
- Binary
- Hexadecimal
- ASCII
- ROT13
- Caesar Cipher
- Cryptii

- XOR
- One-Time Pad
- Codebooks
	- Mary Queen of Scots Ciphers
- Steganography
- APT
- Cryptography (Randomware, Hashing)
- Race Condition

- Diffie-Hellman-Merkle Key Exchange
- Email Headers
	  Already covered, this is sorted.
	  
- Phishing
	  Done, somewhat for now, although much more JS to learn :) 
	  
- Third Party Email Providers
- MX Records
	  This has already been described in it's own section, somewhere.. :P 
	  
- SPF Records (Sender Policy Framework)
	  same as above
	  
- DMARC & DKIM Basics
	  Same as above
	  
- Email Blocklists
	- A record that contains IP addresses and/or domains that have been flagged by spam filters
	- Servers use this information to determine which addresses to block. Either by diverting directly to a spam folder, or by disallowing the send to occur at all
	- Needing to look into how this is different from blacklisting
	  
- TCP / UDP
	  These I already know - and have the intention of elaborating further where needed
	  
- Ports
	  List of ports have been created in their relevant section, a section which is a forever WIP
	  
- Lavabit
	  A tool to use to encrypt emails
	  Was shut down in 2013, Edward Snowden was known to be using this tool
	  Has been resurrected in 2017
		  Noted in Tools
				  This and Protonmail have been described
				  A todo has been set aside to do some research into proper open-source alternatives at a later date

- Hashing
	  Somewhat defined already (in its own section), will be touched on again
- Checksums
	  I think that has been put into the Cryptography section albeit that it is hashing, will elaborate further as I go through various sections
	  
- Integrity, tegrity farms :) 

- Password Storage
	- bcrypt
	- scrypt
	- Argon2
	- PBKDF2
	- Salts
		  I want to go through these more, and do some testing when I have time, has been added to Todos
		  
		  
- MattKC Video on PS2 Savefile Recovery
	  Added to ToDos

- Understanding File Formats
	  umm.... Yes. However, these are different from "file Extensions" as those can be manipulated off the bat.
	  The actual format of the file is how it was encoded/organised
