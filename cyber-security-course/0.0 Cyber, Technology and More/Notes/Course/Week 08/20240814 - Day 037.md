Python
- Socket stuff
- Can create a
	- Client
	- Server
	- Proxy
- Installing pipx
- Checking for
	- bpython
	- ptpython
- IF YOU NEED To add to PATH after trying to run bpython and/or ptpython:
	- for zsh
		- first configure ~/.zshrc (or .bashrc, or whatever depending on the shell you are running)
		- Add the below to the bottom of the file
		- `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
	- load it
		- `source ~\.zshrc`

- `bpython`
	- `ctrl+l`
		- Will bring the bpython session to the top of the screen
		`import socket
	 	`server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`
	 	`server_socket.bind("localhost", 6969)`
		`server_socket.bind(("localhost", 6969))`
		`server_socket.listen()`
			- There is a service that can act as a proxy between connections if the service above is running as root
			- `cap_net_bind` service can be set in place if needed
			- This isn't really needed in today's time though
	- Set up a client to connect to the server above
		- Can use netcat, nc initially for the sake of testing
		- Send something
	- Server-side
		 `client1, addr1 = server_socket.accept()`
		 `client1`
				`<socket.socket fd=10, family=2, type=1, proto=0, laddr=('127.0.0.1', 6969), raddr=('127.0.0.1', 36056)>`
		 `client1.send(b"test message")`
			 This will then send out to the client side
		 `client1.send(b"\n\n\x41\x42\x43")`
			 Will send this in hex, the client side will receive
			 ABC
		 `client1.send(b"\n\n\x48\x45\x4C\x4C\x4f`") 
			 Will send this in hex, the client side will receive
			 HELLO
	 - Client-side
		 send something in the nc listener that was set up by typing something :) 
	 - Server-side
		 - `client1.recv(1024)` (set 1024 bytes to be received)
			
Python
- Tuple Unpacking
	- `mylist = [1, 2, 3]`
	- `x, y, z = mylist`
	- `print(x)`
	- 1
	- `print(z)`
	- 3

- Vim
	- `shift + zq`
		- exit without saving
	- `shift + zz`
		- Test this lol
