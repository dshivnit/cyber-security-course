- Automation is heavily ingrained in the SDLC and DevOps processes
- While this is good for production by allowing for faster development and deployment - it does introduce new security risks.
- When these processes are manual, an attacker would have to focus their efforts to compromise the credentials or workstation of the individual that performed the related process
- With Automation - an attacker can instead go for the pipeline itself

- DevOps Pipelines
	- Source Code Storage and Version Control
		- Dependency Management
	- Continuous Integration
		- Automated Testing
	- Environments

- Source Code and Version Control
	- Several considerations when deciding on where to store code:
		- How can access control to source code be performed
		- How can we ensure that changes made are tracked
		- Can the source code storage system be integrated with the use of our development tools
		- Can multiple different versions of the source code be stored and actively used
		- Should the source code be hosted internally, or via the use of an external third-party's services/systems
	- Version Control
		- Version Control is needed for two main reasons:
			- New features are often being integrated in the software
				- Development methodologies like Agile would normally depict that the code is constantly being updated
				- To ensure that all these updates are kept organised, and in-check, version control is needed
			- Normally it would be a team working on the application/code, not just a single person
				- To ensure that that different versions created by different parts of the greater team (multiple teams), version control would be needed
		- Version Control allows for multiple versions of the code to be kept
	- Common Tools
		- Git
			- Distributed source control tool
			- Each contributor will have their own copy of the source code
		- SubVersion
			- SVN is a centralised source control tool
			- The control of the repository is managed centrally
		- GitHub 
			- is the largest provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git
		- Gitlab 
			- You can also host your own Git server using software such as Gitlab
		- SubVersion (SVN)
			- TortoiseSVN
			- Apache SVN
		- Gitlab (and others) provide much more than just storage and version control features - these tools can be used for almost the entire pipeline
	- Security Considerations
		- Ensuring that source code is not exposed
		- Authentication and access control for the source code is important
		- Ensuring that changes and updates are adequately tracked
			- Allowing us to go back to previous versions if something happens like a bubu
		- Note - taking care as to what is stored as part of the source code
			- Sometimes can't be fully secret as developers will need access to it
		- Do NOT confuse Source Code Storage with Secret Management
		- ENSURE to NOT to store secrets, like database connection strings and credentials, in our source code
		- Since all versions of the source code is kept - even if secrets are removed in a newer version, they will still be exposed in previous versions..
	- GIT NEVER FORGETS
		- NEVER STORE SECRETS IN ANY SOURCE CODE.
			- Any user with access to the repository can look at historical commits and changes that were made
		- GITTYLEAKS
			- An attacker can use tools like Gittyleaks if they somehow got access to the repository
			- Which would can through the commits for sensitive information

- Dependency Management
