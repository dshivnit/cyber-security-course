- The asterisk `*` 
	- Treated as a wildcard
	- Example:
		- `touch {file_a,file_b,file_c}`
		- `echo something: file*`
		- something: file_a file_b file_c
	- `echo */temp`
		- socat/temp THM/temp
		- Essentially listening any directories that have a folder named temp in it
- The question mark `?`
	- Like the wildcard, but only matches one character
	- `cd Deskto?`
		- ~/Desktop
	- `cd ?esk?op`
		- ~/Desktop
- The square brackets `[ ]`
	- A limited form of `?` 
	- a subset of potential characters which are specified within the brackets
	- Example:
		- `cd [DQWE]esk[tpoinm]op`
		- ~/Desktop
	- `touch {file_a,file_b,file_c}`
	- `echo randomness: file_[ab]`
	- randomness: file_a file_b
- The exclamation `!` or the carrot/hat `^`
	- `echo lookie: file_[^ab]`
	- file_c
	- The exclamation seems to have removed everything after it in the command (for me)
