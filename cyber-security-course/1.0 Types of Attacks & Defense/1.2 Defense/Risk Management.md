- Every activity entails some level of risk
- Risk is the possibility that something unwanted or harmful might happen due to an action, or an event.

- Risk Avoidance
- Risk Acceptance
- Risk Reduction

- Risk Management
	- The process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risks associated with a particular situation or activity
	- Deals with threats to a computer system and its resources (in IT/InfoSys)

Terminologies
- Threat
	- An intentional or accidental event that can compromise the security of an information system
	- Examples - hacking, phishing attacks, human error, and natural disasters
- Vulnerability
	- A software, hardware, or network weakness that cybercriminals can exploit to gain unauthorised access or compromise a system
- Asset
	- A valuable resource or component (tangible or intangible) that an organisation relies upon to achieve its objectives
- Risk
	- The probability of a threat source exploiting an existing vulnerability, and resulting in adverse business effects
- Risk Management
	- The process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risk to maintain acceptable levels

Threat
- A potential harm or danger to an individual, organisation, or system
- Threats can be classified into three main categories
	- Human-made
	- Technical
	- Natural
- Human-made Threats
	- Caused by human activities or interventions
		- Terrorism
		- Wars and conflicts
		- Riots and civil unrest
		- Cyberattacks
		- Industrial accidents
		- Arson
	- Not limited to cyber attacks - although they do not require technical expertise, arson is a grave threat.
- Technical Threats
	- These result from technological failures, malfunctions or vulnerabilities
		- Power outages
		- Software and hardware failures
		- Data breaches
		- Network and system vulnerabilities
		- Equipment malfunctions
	- A power outage can halt an entire company without a backup power source.
- Natural threats
	- These are threats caused by natural events or phenomena
		- Earthquakes
		- Floods

Vulnerability
- A weakness in the system or software that can be exploited by a threat to cause harm
- It is a weakness that can be exploited by malicious individuals, groups, or external factors to gain unauthorised access, cause damage, or compromise the integrity or confidentiality of a system, data or network
- Can arise through software bugs, misconfigurations, outdated security

Asset
- An economic resource owned or controlled by an individual, company, or government
- Typically has the potential to provide some future benefit. Assets can include cash an cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, stock, equipment, real estate, and intellectual property
- In the context of IT 
	- Hardware - servers, workstations, routers, switches, firewalls, and other physical devices used to store, process and transmit information
	- Software - operating systems, applications, databases, and other programs that enable the organisations to perform its functions efficiently and effectively
	- Data - Organisational data, which includes sensitive information such as customer records, financial data, intellectual property, and personal data of employees
	- Documentation - Manuals, policy documents

Risk 
- Risk is the probability of a threat source exploiting an existing vulnerability (in an asset) and resulting in adverse business effects
- Risk is the potential of encountering unforeseen events or circumstances that may lead to a loss, damage, or negative outcome. It is the possibility of an undesirable consequence from an uncertain situation, and it can be present in various aspects of life, such as finance, health, and personal relationships. 
- In a business context - it is the probability of a threat source exploiting an existing vulnerability and resulting in adverse business affects. Since the existence of assets is taken for granted, some references omit assets from the visual representation
- In information systems - risk refers to the potential threats, vulnerabilities, and negative consequences arising from the interaction between IT infrastructure, software applications, data, and users. 
- It deals with the uncertainties organisations face in ensuring their digital assets' confidentiality, integrity and availability

Risk Management
- Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risks associated with a particular situation or activity. 
	- It involves identifying potential risks, assessing their likelihood and impact, evaluating possible solutions, and implementing the chosen solutions to limit or mitigate risk. 
	- It also involves monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of the solutions put in place
- A Risk Management Policy is a set of procedures and processes designed to minimise the chances of an adverse event or outcome for an organisation.
	- It helps organisations identify, assess, and manage potential and actual risks related to their operations, financial activities, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
	- The policy provides guidance on identifying and assessing risks, as well as assigning tasks and responsibilities to those involved in managing them
- Information Systems Risk Management is a system of policies, procedures, and practices that seek to protect a company's computer system from various internal and external threats
	- It includes identifying threats, assessing the probability of their occurrence, and evaluating the effectiveness of various measures that can be taken to limit the damage they could cause. 
	- The process also involves determining the resources that should be allocated to respond to potential threats, as well as monitoring and maintaining the integrity of the system
