Terminologies and Others:
- ghidra
- MicroKernels
	- Needed to have Device Drivers installed manually
- Monolithic Kernels
	- Linux developed a system wherein Drivers were already a part of the base system - so when a device was plugged in, it would work immediately
- Summary of the previous two points
	- Monolithic kernels are characterised by their tight integration of system services and high performance, while microkernals are characterised by their modularity, simplicity and security
