- Going through Claude LLM
- claude.ai
	- Anthropic's Claude
- Discussing OpenAI
- Will be going through some coding/unit-testing again
- 
---
- Companies like Claude, due to their size, would mainly ask for personal details when creating accounts such as full name, contact details (email, phone) to be able to prevent from bots making queries
	- Running queries takes extensive resources to operate efficiently - ie GPUs
	- Keeping queries genuine from actual end-users and not automated scripts/bots etc
- Going through https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU
- https://course.fast.ai/

- Lint in programming
	- Just like lint in clothing, washing clothing
	- Cleaner code
- PyLint
	- `pip install pylint`
- Black
	- `pip install black`
	- https://github.com/psf/black
- PEP8
	- Python Styling
	- "make sure your indentation is four spaces"
	- Defines styles and so on
	- https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
- GOFMT
	- For the GO language
	- Go Format
- docstring
	- A line within triple quotes that would define a function, and from where Python can generate documentation for you automatically
	- `python -m pydoc`

Terminologies and Stuff:
- Refactoring
	- Cutting down the lines of code and redundancy in coding
- Large Language Models
	- LLMs
	- Use of Tokens (when determining words)
		- Token Limit
		- Context Length
			- How much the AI can store in its 'head' at any given time
			- Similar to how humans have a context-length with how much can be remembered in a short space of time
			- example: 4000 token context-length limit
	- AI Hallucination
		- When an AI model runs out of context-length, they start to regurgitate nonsense
		- Once the system runs out of RAM/GPU-RAM - hallucination will occur
		- Which is why there has been a race to buy up all the graphics cards in the market(s)
- Infinite numbers and how computers deal with them
	- Precision-point floating numbers
	- Fixed-point numbers
		- Used in financial systems, when you don't want to deal with rounding inaccuracies
- Like a multi-dimensional vector space
- Anthropic's Claude
- NLP
	- Natural Language Processing
- nat.dev
- Firefox Relay
- Movie - Office Space
	- Guys writing accounting software, what if we take these extra digits that have been rounded off and we put this in a bank account somewhere
	- They do this and they make a mistake
- 51% attack
	- In cryptominin, a blockchain by an entity or group that controls more than 50% of the network
- AI, like Cryptocurrency, everything is still running on GPUs
	- There has been the creation of TPUs (Tensor Processing Unit)
		- Designed for storing Tensors, large mathematical spreadsheets on them
		- Google, other companies, working on TPUs
- Using AI to be able to know it's limitations
	- And to not get left behind
- idempotent
	- Denoting an element of a set which is unchanged in value when multiplied or otherwise operated on by itself
- Absolute function
	- Abs
	- Getting the positive function from a negative number
	- The absolute value or modulus of a real number, denoted, is the non-negative value of without regard to its sign. 
	- The absolute value of 3 is 3
	- The absolute value of -3 is 3
- Local LLM solutions
	- LM Studio
	- Ollama (Go based backend - can write your own code which interacts with front-end)
	- Gemma
	- Llama3
- dxdiag
- Quantisation
	- process of mapping input values from a large set (often continuous set) to output values in a countable smaller set, often with a finite number of elements
	- Think about a volume knob that have levels from 0 to 10, but you only use 3 5 and 7
		- Getting rid of the other levels to ones that are only used
	- `gemma-2--9b-it-Q3_K_L.gguf`
		- 9 billion knobs
		- Three 
- huggingface.co/models
- Prompt Injection
	- in AI
- Fine tuning an AI Model
- Synesthesia? 
	- A phenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, such as tasting colours or feeling sounds

- Integration test
	- More important than unit test
	- Testing if the different function you have, work well with each other
- Continuous Integration
	- A piece of software, running, that monitors your gitrepository it will run the pytest command
	- A script, if tests pass, then it is ready to go on to deployment
	- if it fails, then a notification is sent out to all that need to hear it
- Deployment
	- Different ways to deploy your code
	- Containers
	- SSH to copy scripts across to a server
	- FTP to upload files to a server
- Code Review
	- Single return point
	- Clearer
