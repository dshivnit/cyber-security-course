- Third-party Vendor Risks
	- Potential security and operational challenges introduced by external entities (vendors, suppliers, or service providers)
	- When we integrate external partners into our operational ecosystem, we open up the avenues to potential threats and vulnerabilities 
		- That could affect our company's integrity, data security and overall business continuity
	- Some of what it could be:
		- a hardware provider who's components have vulnerabilities
		- A software supplier who's application has a hidden backdoor
		- Or a service provider, like a MSP, that has access to sensitive data - but lacks rigorous cyber security protocols
