Disclosure
- Opposite of Confidentiality
- Disclosure of data would be an attack on confidentiality
- ie - A threat actor is able to breach into a top-secret intelligence agency's data banks and exfiltrate all their confidential data, and then exposes it to the worldwide audience. What kind of impact will that have on the country that was attacked, what will the rest of the world think?
Alteration
- Opposite of Integrity
- ie - An adversary manages to manipulate and alter patient records for an entire country and swap details around with various people. What happens when you next visit a clinic? What kind of history will they have on file for you? What will your impression be of them and the national healthcare system??
Destruction/Denial
- The opposite of Availability
- ie - A hospital decides to go completely paperless. An attacker succeeds in making the database systems unavailable. The hospital is now unable to access any patient records... What to do
