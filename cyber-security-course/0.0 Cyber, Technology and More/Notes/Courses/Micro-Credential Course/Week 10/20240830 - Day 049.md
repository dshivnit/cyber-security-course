Terminologies and Stuff:
- Joe Armstrong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer))
	- Erlang
	- Blackholes for computation
- Tom Kilburn
- Blackhole Computers?
- Bitflips
	- "Before a measurement is taken, a bit flip isÂ **a swap of those two probabilities**. The probability of measuring 0 is now the probability of measuring 1, and vice versa. A bit flip error means that this has happened unintentionally, and therefore undesirably." 
	- - The states of computers
	- Not being the same of each other
	- but full on different
	- Bitflips caused due to radiation (and others?) when humans typing domain names say for example, like windows.com, but signals along the way get "bitflipped" into something else
		- Studies have been done into this
		- Not on human-error
		- But an anomaly what is bitflip
	- A C program can have more states than the number of atoms on the planet!!!!!
	- Finite State Machine:
		- State x Event -> New State
		- ie in a video game, take Mario
			- Stationary state
			- Walking state
			- Running state
			- Jumping state
			- Shooting state
			- Running and jumping
			- Running, jumping and shooting
		- So you use the concepts of a finite state machine to control the various states that your program can be in 
- Fault tolerance
	- Being able to handle the system when one machine goes down say for example
	- Distributed networking/systems
	- Bitcoin Blockchain is one of the best systems at fault tolerance

- Electricity being cut off to hot water tanks in the middle of the night?
	- Look into this
	- In comparison to gas? 
- Look into seeing what happens to excess electricity
	- Arching? Switching? Something like that

- anthropomorphizing
	- Attribute human characteristics or behaviour to (a god, animal, or object)

	- Great tool
	- Used this back in the day to check out what Gabrielle was shaping out like
	- Can also check chemicals/particles in the air
	- and so on
- NTP using UTC globally
- Erlang
	- Consider a car that's driving, gets a flat tyre, keeps on driving and has the ability to change the damaged wheel/tyre. 
	- You can do this with Python referencing C
		- Being able to access memory in real-time
		- Doing redirects in memory to where various parts of the code are running from
		- On the fly!
		- Take that fraction of the program from memory - make a copy of it and place it in another block of memory
			- Consider Parent Child processes and being able to do this
			- Recall the times with Java and doing system/hardware calls
- 1 second apart?
