Networking:
- Going through the OSI Model
- I have made notes on this in other sections of this repo, the main one being:
	- [[Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) Stack (Model -- I call it a stack alright! =P)]]
- QoS
	- Quality of Service
	- The prioritisation of packets that are being transferred/received
- 802.11 standards
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11
- Subnetting:
	- Decrease Network Chatter that can happen across Network(s)
	- Network Architects/Engineers need to be able to identify how many IP addresses will be needed for any given subnet depending on the scope of what will be involved, requirements etc
	- Subnet Mask determines whether a packet that is sent goes local, or straight to the Router/Gateway to go somewhere else
	- Numbers to remember
		- 128
		- 192
		- 224
		- 240
		- 248
		- 252
		- 254
		- 255
	- Binary
		- NOT
		- OR
		- AND
			- Comparing these two, A and B Bytes:
				- A 
					- 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 
				- B
					- 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 
					- OR will equal (is there at least one 1 bit in A and B? ):
						- 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 
					- AND will equal (A and B both have to be 1's):
						- 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 
		- AND
			- Taking the IP Address against the Subnet Mask will give you the NETWORK ADDRESS
	- Network Address
		- IP AND Subnet Mask
		- The Address that will define the entire Network
	- Broadcast Address
		- The NOT of either the IP Address or the NOT of the Subnet Mask
			- in example:
				- 192.168.1.164
					- in Binary:
						- 11000000.10101000.00000001.10100100
				- 255.255.255.0
					- in Binary:
						- 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
				- AND will be:
					- in Binary:
						- 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
					- 192.168.1.0
				- NOT will be:
					- In Binary:
						- 00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111
					- 0.0.0.255
				- OR will be:
					- In Binary:
						- 11000000.10101000.00000001.11111111
					- 192.168.1.255
				- Network:
					- 192.168.1.0
				- Broadcast:
					- 192.168.1.255
	- Subnets have the Whack (`/`) and subnet mask after - ie `/24` 
	- Another example
	- IP:
		- 173.245.48.137/20 (subnet mask of 255.255.240.0)
		- Subnet Mask: 
			- 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000
				- The 1s here will be the "Network Bits"
				- The 0's signify the "Host Bits"
		- 173.245.48.137
			- In bits:
				- 10101101.11110101.00110000.10001001
		- the AND:
			- 10101101.11110101.00110000.00000000
		- the OR:
			- 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000
			- 00000000.00000000.00111111.11111111
		- Subnet:
			- 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000
		- Broadcast:
			- 10101101.11110101.00111111.11111111
	- An IP Address is really just an integer
	- The above has been better defined in the [[Networking]] page

ToDo:
- Go through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11 again especially focusing on 802.11ax, 802.11be, 802.11bn
- Go through the NOT OR AND subnetting routes and find somewhere to practice this practically :)
