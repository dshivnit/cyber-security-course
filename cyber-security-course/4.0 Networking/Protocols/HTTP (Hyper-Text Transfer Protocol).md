- HTTP Methods
	- GET
		- Used for when getting information from a web server
	- POST
		- Used for submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records
	- PUT
		- Used for submitting data to a web server to update information
	- DELETE
		- Used for deleting information/records from a web server

- HTTP Status Codes (https://http.cat/)
	- 100-199 (information responses)
	- 200-299 (Success)
	- 300-399 (Redirection)
	- 400-499 (Client Errors)
	- 500-599 (Server Errors)

- Common HTTP Request Headers
	- Host
		- Some web servers host multiple websites so by providing the host headers you can tell it which one you require
	- User-Agent
		- Your browser software and version number
		- Telling the webserver your browser software helps it format the website properly for the client you are running
	- Content-Length
		- When sending data to a web server such as in a form, the content length tells the web server how much data to expect in the web request. 
		- This way the server can ensure that it isn't missing any data
	- Accept-Encoding
		- Tells the web server what types of compression methods the browser supports so that the data can be made smaller for transmitting over the Internet. 
	- Cookie
		- Data sent to the server to help remember your information
- Common HTTP Response Headers
	- Set-Cookie
		- Information to store which gets sent back to the web server on each request
	- Cache-Control
		- How long to store the content of the response in the browsers cache before it requests it again
	- Content-Type
		- Tells the client what type of data is being returned
			- HTML
			- CSS
			- JavaScript
			- Images
			- PDF
			- Video
			- etc
	- Content-Encoding
		- What method has been used to compress the data to make it smaller when sending it over the Internet
- Cookies
	- Can be used for many purposes but most commonly for Website Authentication. 
	- Won't usually be a clear plaintext string where you can see the password, but a token
	- Clear these upon browser-exit every time please whoever is reading this :) 

- Security Headers
	- Help improve the overall security of a web application by providing mitigations against attacks like XSS, Clickjacking and others.
	- Some headers:
		- CSP - Content-Security-Policy
		- HSTS - Strict-Transport Security
		- X-content-Type-Options
		- Referrer-Policy
- [https://securityheaders.io/](https://securityheaders.io/)
	- A good tool to check the security headers of any website
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
	- A CSP Header is an additional layer of security that can assist in mitigating common attacks like XSS (cross-site scripting). 
	- Malicious code could reside in a different website or domain, and injected into a vulnerable website.
	- CSPs provide a way for admins to set which domains or sources are considered to be safe and provides a layer of mitigation to such attacks.
	- Various properties can be defined which give options to define what levels of granularity, domains/sites are allowed for with what type of content.
	- Example header:
		- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self https://cdn.somethingname.com; style-src 'self'` 
			- `default-src`
				- Specifies the default policy of self, which means 'only the current website'
			- `script-src`
				- Specifies the policy for where scripts can be loaded from, which is self along withs scripts hosted on the given site afterwards
			- `style-src`
				- Specifies the policy for where CSS style sheets can be loaded from
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
	- This header ensures that web-browsers can only connect over HTTPS
	- Example:
		- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63000000; includeSubDomains; preload`
			- `max-age`
				- Expiry time in seconds for this 'setting'
			- `includeSubDomains`
				- Optional
				- A setting that instructs the browser to apply this setting to all subdomains of a website
			- `preload`
				- Optional
				- Allows the website to be included in 'preload lists'
				- Browsers can use preload lists to enforce HSTS before even having their first visit to a website that has this enabled
- X-Content-Type-Options
	- This header can be used to instruct browsers to NOT guess the MIME type of a resource, but only use the `Content-Type` header. 
	- Example:
		- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
			- `nosniff`
				- Tells the browser to not sniff, or guess the MIME type..
- Referrer-Policy
	- This header controls the amount of information sent to the destination web server when a user is redirected from a source web server
		- Say for example when they click a hyperlink
	- Allows a web-admin to control what information is shared
	- Examples:
		- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
			- Completely disables any information sent about the referrer
		- `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`
			- Will only send referrer information when the destination is a part of the same 'origin'
			- Helpful when you want referrer information passed when hyperlinks are within the same website, but not to external/outside web-systems
		- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin`
			- This policy only sends the referrer as the origin when the protocol stays the same
				- ie, the referrer is sent when a HTTPS connection goes to another HTTPS connection
		- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
			- Similar to `strict-origin`, where it sends the full URL path in the origin header
