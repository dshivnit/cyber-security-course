 - DMARC
	 - Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Compliance
	 - An email authentication protocol
	 - It is designed to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorised use, commonly known as email spoofing
	 - The purpose and primary outcome of implementing DMARC is to protect a domain from being used in business email compromise attacks, phishing, email and email scams
	- Receiving mail-servers can authenticate incoming emails based on the instructions published by the domain owner within the DNS entry
		- If email passes the authentication, it will be delivered and trusted
		- If it fails the check, depending on the instructions held within the DMARC record, the email could be delivered, quarantined, or rejected.

- SPF Alignment
	- The alignment of two headers found in an email message, meaning the value found in those two headers (a domain) needs to align with one another
	- This alignment basically means that the value found in each header, which is a domain must match with the domain found in the other header
	- An SPF Alignment PASS indicates that there is an exact match to the domain (ie, `outlook.com = outlook.com`) OR if there is a parent and a child match (a parent domain and a sub-domain)
		(mxtoolbox)
- SPF Authenticated
	- SPF can be evaluated in two ways - authentication and alignment. 
	- An email passes SPF authentication when delivered from an IP address published in the SPF policy for the domain found in the envelope "mail from:" designator. 
	- Essentially the IP address that sent the email must match an IP address published in the SPF record for the domain
		(mxtoolbox)
- DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) Alignment
	- Two types of alignment exist. 
	- One is based on SPF, while the other is based on DKIM
	- The alignment test for DKIM is performed in order to verify the authenticity of the domain sending the email by using two signatures found in the message where the sender's domain is present
		- The *from* domain
		- The dkim domain (*d=tag*) from the DKIM-Signature header
	- To achieve DKIM alignment, the from header visible to the receiver must match the domain in the DKIM-signature header
	- By default, this test will look for a loose match between the two domains (domain/domain or parent domain/child domain) 
- DKIM Authenticated
	- DKIM can be achieved in two ways
		- Authentication
		- Alignment
	- An email passes DKIM authentication when correctly signed by the d= domain in the DKIM header
	- A DKIM-Signature is added to the header of outbound messages by the sender, and the recipient then compares the included signature to a publicly available DKIM key for decoding. 
	- If decoded, the message is authenticated as being from the shown sender.
 
 - Email delivery over the Internet requires these:
	 - MSA - Mail Submission Agent
		 - MUA's connect to these to send their emails
		 - MSA's will check incoming messages for any errors before transferring it to the MTA (the MSA and MTA are usually on the same server)
	 - MTA - Mail Transfer Agent
		 - Will transmit the message to the MTA of the receiving party
		 - SMTP is used to communicate with MTA servers
		 - (do note, normal SMTP transfers data in plaintext, you want to use the TLS version of SMTP, SMTPS which is the standard now. Should be.)
	 - MDA - Mail Delivery Agent
		 - Receiving MUA will receive its message from an MDA
		 - POP3 or IMAP (TLS/SSL versions) are used 
	 - MUA - Mail User Agent
		 - An email client
 
 - Protocols:
	 - SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
		- Utilised to handle the sending of emails
		- SMTP Secure Port: 587 (formerly 465)
	- POP3 (Post Office Protocol)
		- Responsible for transferring emails between a client and a mail server
		- Emails are downloaded and stored on a single device
		- Sent messages are stored on the device from which the email was sent
		- If you want to keep messages on the server, ensuring to have the "Keep Mail on the Server" is enabled
			- Else all messages are deleted from the server once downloaded on to the single devices email client
		- POP3 Secure Port: 445
	- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
		- Responsible for transferring emails between a client and a mail server
		- IMAP Secure Port: 443

- How an email is sent:
	- Sending mail client
	- SMTP server
	- DNS server
	- back to the original SMTP server
	- Through a firewall
	- Over the Internet
	- Through another Firewall
	- SMTP server
	- POP3/IMAP server
	- To the Receiving mail client
	
- Email Headers:
	- Information about the email - such as the email servers that relayed the email
	- Email messages use the syntax known as IMF (Internet Message Format) 
	- Basic Header:
		- From
		- Subject
		- Date
		- To
	- Raw/Full Headers
		- Can be pulled from the email client one is using (process is client version/developer dependent)
	- How to analyse an Email Header
		- NOTE: every line can be forged when reading an Email Header
		- ONLY the received lines that are created by your service or computer should be trusted.
		- Run the headers (full/raw version) in MXToolbox or something similar (however, MXToolbox is awesome :) ) and review the RECEIVED section or trust that in comparison to the rest
	- Custom Email Headers
		- Starting with "X-"
			- are custom headers the sender can add
			- The X prefix is usually to denote that the header is not official or standardised, as what the IETF does
				- The IETF are the Internet Engineers Task Force
					- They create the technical standards that make up the Internet Protocol suite. 
			- These custom headers often provide additional information or metadata about the email, such as
				- tagging the email for spam filtering
				- sorting purposes
				- adding information specific to a particular organisation or system

- Email Body
	- Either in plain-text or in HTML
	- Can also view the source of the message
		- If there are attachments then you can see details around the attachment
			- Content-Disposition:
			- Content-Transfer-Encoding:
			- Content-Type:
		- Always be careful to not just open any random (and or any) attachment
		- 
- IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
	- The standard that emails generally follow is defined by the IETF
		- Specifically RFC 5322
			- Which specifies the syntax and semantics of email messages
		- RFC 2045-2049
			- which defines the MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards for email messages on the Internet
