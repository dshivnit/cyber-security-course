- Blockchain
	- blockchain.com
		- Explorer
- Sender 
- One or more Recipients 
- Base58
- Blockchains are rampant with ransomware 
- Vulnerabilities with cloning
	- Lacking of knowledge in knowing how to prevent security issues arising
- "Bitcoin is king" meme
	- SHA256 algorithm
	- So much momentum
	- Proof of work can be improved
	- ASIC
		- Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
- Information stealers
- Blockchain
	- Is a ledger
	- a big list of transactions (TXNs)
	- Fees
		- Sats
			- Abbreviation of Satoshi
- Private Key
- Bitcoin Node
- Mining
	- taking a block of transactions (a chuck of transactions) - taking a set of transactions
		- Taking the previous hash
		- Take the previous block hash
		- Take the Nonce
		- Combine the .....
- (need to review Blockchain basics here..)
- Tight havens
- Network can be spammed with invalid transactions
- Blockchain forking
	- Occurs when a blockchain splits into two competing paths
	- The cause of forks can vary
- Outgoing transactions usually have two outputs
	- The amount going to the intended recipient
	- The returning amount going back to the sender
	- Essentially what happens is that the entire wallet amount is sent in a transaction
		- The amount dedicated for the recipient is sent to them
		- The remaining amount is returned to the senders wallet
		- 1 transaction
			- 2 Outputs
	- Block awards halve every four years approximately
	- By the 2030s it is seen that the system would have normalised and balanced wherein people would be making from transaction fees as opposed to block rewards
- Blockchain Forks
	- BTC
		- Satoshi generated the Genesis block
			- Block 1
			- The very first block
			- Mined on January 9th, 2009
			- 50BTC as the block rewards at this time
			- This was Satoshi running the software for a few months or so 
			- Historical records
		- Empty blocks can be dos'd wherein someone is mining it and preventing others from sending transactions to it
- Dust
	- The amount remaining in a blockchain wallet that isn't enough to cover transaction fees
- Exchange exit scams
- The amount of power consumption required to process blocks compared to how much is yielded (for the BTC blockchain) --- is it viable?

People:
- Vitalik Buterin

Terminologies and Random Stuff:
- Salary
	- From ancient Roman times depicting salt? 
- ASIC
	- Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
- Dusting attack
	- Sending monies to a wallet ID
	- Then waiting for that Wallet ID to start working with that dust (small) amount of crypto
	- Then analyse as to what they do with it
		- If they withdraw it
		- Where?
		- Geolocations etc
- Chainalysis
	- Do analyses on blockchains
	- IDs
	- Hashes
- Nodes
	- Someone who is running the software, with not the purpose to mine, but to act as someone who can ask you questions as to whether this is a valid transaction
	- Node is P2P software
		- Keeps track of other nodes that it knows
- Escrow Handlers
	- Exchanges! lol
- Order Books
	- Potential Transactions
- MTGOX
	- MTG Online eXchange
- MultiSig wallet
	- Multi-signature wallet
	- Needs to be signed off by additional parties before a transaction can take place
	- Good security precaution
- Combinatorics
	- Field of maths concerned with problems of selection, arrangement, and operation within a finite or discrete system
- Setting up a node
	- Electrum.org
- Node
	- Verify the transactions are valid (the tx's that come in)
	- Then send those txs out across the network
- Duplicate Blocks
	- When miners are working towards the same block
	- Which area/region can block the fastest to complete their block will broadcast that to the network
	- The other miners working on the same block number but were beaten to complete it by the other one have their work discarded
		- This is called a Transaction Rollback
- Double Spend
- - 51% attack
	- If a mining pool has 51% or more on a network
	- They can make out of thin air transactions, such as a block reward which isn't bona-fide
	- 

- GPG 
	- GNU Privacy Guard

- Wallets

	- Electrum
- NANO Blockchain
