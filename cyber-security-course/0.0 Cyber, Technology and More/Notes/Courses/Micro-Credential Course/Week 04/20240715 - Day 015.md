- Open Source Intelligence Server
- Honey Pot
- Covering Networking stuff
- Review of the last two weeks topics that have been covered
- Ghidra
- Wireshark
- CPU Registers
- Hashes p/s 
	- Kilo Hashes per second
	- Millions Hashes per second
	- Giga hashes per second
- MD5 reverse lookup
- bcrypt
	- Allows you to tweak some parameters to control how much CPU time is taken per hash
		- ie 100m/s per hash
		- To be able to slow brute force attacks for example
- GPU password cracking (as opposed to CPU)
- scrypt (ess crypt)
	- Colin Percival
	- Allows you to tweak how much memory the hashing uses
- Argon2
- You don't want a fast hashing algorithm (makes it faster to crack a password) (ie MD5, SHA256)
- PBKDF2
- Rainbow Table
	- Data structure to make it fast to lookup what the password or input was for a given hash 
- Time vs Space
- Pepper
	- Lives outside of the main DB table that as login details
- IoC - Indicator of Compromise

Networking:
- Similar to a postal system
		- You'd normally write the name of the person
		- Their address
		- unit/number, street, suburb, city, postcode
	- Delivery of the package (various processing plants etc) 
		- Local, International (will be different)
		- Delivery methods as well, there will be the local postman/courier, then a freightforwarding company, etc etc
- OSI Layer Open-Systems Interconnect (Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away) :) 
	- L's 1-7
- TCP/IP Stack/Model
	- Network Access
		- MAC (media-access control) Address (physical address)
		- Hexadecimal numbers 
			- First-three bytes refer to the manufacturer company
			- Second three refer to the actual device (Device ID)
		- ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
			- ARP spoofing
	- Internet
		- IP Addresses 
		- WiFi networks have their own physical address (MAC)
	- Transport
	- Application
- Broadcasts Domains
- Private Networks (commonly used for home LANs)
- Static IP Addresses
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol)
	- Dynamic IP Addresses
- Keep note of having multiple DHCP servers in some setups/systems
	- Rogue DHCP servers
- Network Management
	- Having a system that can actively pick up anomalies in the network/system
- IPC - Inter-Process Communication
	- How different processes on your computer can speak with each other when they can't see eachothers memory allocation
	- They will create a network connection on the Loopback Traffic Capture interface to be able to speak with each other
- ICMP
	- Responsible for detecting nearby devices
- MAC
	- 

Quicklly random:
- blocking a domain, point it in hosts to 127.0.0.1
- 
---
- Wireshark
	- Various Interfaces
	- Loopback Traffic Capture is the interface that capture network traffic that on the loopback interface (I need to double-check this term, but to the local address 127.0.0.1)
	- This allows for applications to be able to speak with eachother normally in situations when they are unable to do so via the inability to see each others processes/threads in memory allocation
	- An exclamation mark before a protocol indicates that those protocols will not be picked up by Wireshark
		- ie TCP and UDP filtered out
	- MDNS
	- There are tools that can be made that can send false ARP packets to essentially create a DOS attack locally
	- Source  / Destination
		- Identifying who has sent the packet and who the packet is intended for
	- FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF <- reserved for broadcast ARP packets
	- QUIC protocol (similar to UDP)
		- Mainly for data streaming
	- ICMP packets live in memory temporarily
	- IN MOST CASES: Save a Wireshark capture as format .pcap
	- PCAP - packet capture file
	- Alternative to sending ping ICMP packets

RANDOM:
- Crisis Actors (lol)
- Shodan
- Security through obscurity (Steganography)
	- Stega > ie hiding an encrypted in an image for example
- Rubicon (TV-series)
- Hackers (1995)
- APT - Advanced Persistent Threat
- Stuxnet
- DNSchecker.org
- Debugging Tools
	- x64 debugger tool
	- ImmunityDebugger
	- R2
	- Windebug
	- Ghidra
	- IDA/IDAPro
	- Win32disassembler (win32dasm)
	- Depends on which OS/System is being considered
- Identifying a MAC address of a host/client (not a networking tool)
	- Identifying the Router
	- Being able to geolocate intended MAC Address
	- Would be bloody tricky to do....

TODO:
- **Go through the snippets from last week and cover those topics (Week 3)** 
- Homework catchup (all in all > add those concepts/information_sets into this Repo)
- Rainbow Table (look at this > not so useful these days as most password/hashes have a salt that is incorporated into it - but for the sake of knowledge)
- Time vs Space
- Pepper (used for all user logins - just an additional layer of security - this is now outdated, but for the sake of knowledge)
	- Lives outside of the main DB table that as login details
	- lol, salt and pepper
- Get the domain back up
- Look into MAC spoofing more to see where it comes (how it comes up ) on the other side
- ARP spoofing
- GCSB - Security Information Manual Manual (https://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-13224)
