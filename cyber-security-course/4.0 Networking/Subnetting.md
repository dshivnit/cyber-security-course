Subnetting:
- Decrease Network Chatter that can happen across Network(s)
- Network Architects/Engineers need to be able to identify how many IP addresses will be needed for any given subnet depending on the scope of what will be involved, requirements etc
- Subnet Mask determines whether a packet that is sent goes local, or straight to the Router/Gateway to go somewhere else
- Numbers to remember
	- 128
	- 192
	- 224
	- 240
	- 248
	- 252
	- 254
	- 255
- Binary
	- NOT
	- OR
		- Comparing these two, A and B Bytes:
			- A 
				- 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 
			- B
				- 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 
				- OR will equal (is there at least one 1 bit in A and B? ):
					- 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 
				- AND will equal (A and B both have to be 1's):
					- 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 
	- AND
		- Taking the IP Address against the Subnet Mask will give you the NETWORK ADDRESS
- Network Address
	- IP AND Subnet Mask
	- The Address that will define the entire Network
- Broadcast Address
	- The NOT of either the IP Address or the NOT of the Subnet Mask
		- in example:
			- 192.168.1.164
				- in Binary:
					- 11000000.10101000.00000001.10100100
			- 255.255.255.0
				- in Binary:
					- 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
			- AND will be:
				- in Binary:
					- 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
				- 192.168.1.0
			- NOT will be:
				- In Binary:
					- 00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111
				- 0.0.0.255
			- OR will be:
				- In Binary:
					- 11000000.10101000.00000001.11111111
				- 192.168.1.255
			- Network:
				- 192.168.1.0
			- Broadcast:
				- 192.168.1.255
- Subnets have the Whack (`/`) and subnet mask after - ie `/24`
