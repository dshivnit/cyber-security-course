- Cyberchef for URL Encoding formats/syntax/transformation
- Burpsuite run
- Browsers outside of Burps Chromium won't have the Burp Certificate installed
	- This would have to be done manually
- Checking the different types of requests that are sent when accessing sites like google.com
- Checking facebook.com 
- Connection: keep-alive 
	- in a Get Request
- Burp Certificate
	- http://burpsuite
		- fake URL that burp/portswigger hosts
		- Get the Cert from the top-right
	- Install the cert 
- Running through CAs (Certificate Authority's)
	- Root Authority's
	- Chain of Trust
		- Intermediary/Subsidiary CAs
		- Registration Authority
	- Non-repudiation
	- Digital signatures
- Creation of Certificates
	- openssl
	- Key pairs
		- Private key
			- Decryption
			- Signing
				- Of Digital Signatures
		- Public key
			- Encryption
			- Verification
		- Metadata
			- Who owns it
			- Who issued it
			- Assigned by an Authority
			- Self-signed
- SSL Certificate Types
	- Wildcard Certificates
		- Risky
		- As some subdomains can be created with malicious intent and automatically is deemed as trustworthy
		- 
- Asymmetric Connection to begin with
	- From within where the symmetric key is agreed upon and a symmetric encryption connection and cipher-set to use
	- Then a Symmetric connection is established in moving forward
- Qualys SSL test 
- ssllabs.com/ssltest
	- If you're wanting to defend real well
		- Do checks against where SSL requests are coming from
		- Pick up on requests coming from Qualys say for example
		- As Qualys sends out a comprehensive detail set in relation to the SSL Cert that is looked up
		- ie tryhackme.com
	- There are headers that are sent
		- X-Forwarded-By
		- Check for headers like this that come in from SSL requests
		- To see if there is an intermediary Web Server/hop inbetween where the request may have been forwarded from
- LetsEncrypt
	- CA
	- Look them up
- TLS
	- Transport Layer Security
- AES
	- Advanced Encryption System
	- Symmetric Encryption
- SHA
	- Secure Hashing Algorithm
- AES-GCM
	- Galois Counter Mode
	- Block-Cipher Mode

- Block Ciphers (these have been described in the Crypto page but go over it again)
	- ECB
	- CBC
	- OFB
	- CFB
	- CTR
	- XTS
- Stream Ciphers
	- 1-bit at a time

- ChaCha20-Poly1305
	- For symmetric encryption


- Going through Blockchain
	- blockchain.com
	- Satoshi Nakamoto
	- Mailing lists post 2008 financial crisis
		- cryptography mailing list
			- Where cryptographers had published niche content within a niche community (lol at notes)
			- This is where Satoshi (or someone called Satoshi) had first shared his idea
		- Bitcoin white paper
			- https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
		- Bitcoin uses SECP256k1

People:
- Ã‰variste Galois
	- Group Theory
	- and Galois Theory
- Hal Finney

Terminologies and Other Stuff:
- ChaCha20 - Poly1305
- Downgrade Attack
	- MITM attack
	- Downgrades the Cipher mode used between the Web-Server and the Client is used
	- MITM will state that they won't be able to support higher, more standard versioned TLS modes and a previous outdated one
	- From where they will be able to then sniff packets easier
- Heartbleed Bug
	- Look into this again

ToDo:
- LetsEncrypt
- Room641a (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A#External_links)
- Galois/Counter (GCM)
		- Takes an IV (Initialisation Vector)
		- Describe this further in the Crypto block
	- Run through the block cipher processes again with the IV's used
		- Initialisation Vector
