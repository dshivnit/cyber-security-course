MISPs core objective is to foster sharing of structured threat information among security analysts, malware researchers and IT professionals.

- MISP is an open-source threat information platform that facilitates the collection, storage and distribution of threat intelligence and IOCs related to malware, cyber attacks, financial fraud, or any intelligence within a community of trusted members
- Follows a distributed model with supported:
	- Closed
	- Semi-private
	- and Open-communities (the public)
- Threat Information can be distributed and consumed by NDIS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems), Log Analysis Tools and SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management systems)

MISP is effectively useful for the following use-cases:
- Malware Reverse Engineering
	- Sharing of malware indicators to understand how different malware families function
- Security Investigations
	- Searching, validating and using indicators in investigating security breaches
- Intelligence Analysis
	- Gathering information about adversary groups and their capabilities
- Law Enforcement
	- Using indicators to support forensic investigations
- Risk Analysis
	- Researching new threats, their likelihood and occurrences
- Fraud Analysis
	- Sharing of financial indicators to detect financial fraud

MISP Core Functionalities
- IOC Database
	- Allows for the storage of technical and non-technical information about malware samples, incidents, attackers and intelligence
- Automatic Correlation
	- Identification of relationships between attributes and indicators from malware, attack campaigns or analysis
- Data Sharing
	- This allows for sharing of information using different models of distributions and among different MISP instances
- Import and Export Features
	- Allows the import and export of events in different formats to integrate other systems such as NIDS, HIDS, and OpenIOC
- Event Graph
	- Showcases the relationships between objects and attributes identified from events
- API Support
	- Supports integration with own systems to fetch and export events and intelligence

Common terms used within MISP and related to functionalities above (and general usage of the platform):
- Events
	- Collection of contextually linked information
	- Published by the **Organisation Admin**
- Attributes
	- Individual data points associated with an event, such as network or system indicators
- Objects
	- Custom attribute compositions
- Object References
	- Relationships between different objects
- Sightings
	- Time-specific occurrences of a given data point or attribute detected to provide more credibility
- Tags
	- Labels attached to events/attributes
- Taxonomies
	- Classification libraries are used to tag, classify and organise information
- Galaxies
	- Knowledge-base items used to label events/attributes
- Indicators
	- Pieces of information that can detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity

Feeds
- Resources that contain indicators that can be imported into MISP and provide attributed information about security events. 
- These feeds provide analysts and organisations with continuously updated information on threats and adversaries and aid in their proactive defence against attacks
- MISP Feeds are a way to:
	- Exchange threat information 
	- Preview events along with associated attributes and objects
	- Select and import events to your instance
	- Correlate attributes identified between events and feeds
- Feeds are enabled by the **Site Admin** which will then allow analysts to obtain information on events and indicators

Taxonomies
- MISP uses tags to categorise events, indicators and threat actors
- Analysts can use taxonomies to:
	- Set events for further processing by external tools like VirusTotal
	- Ensure events are classified appropriately before the Organisation Admin publishes them
	- Enrich IDS' export values with tags that fit specific deployments
- Taxonomies are expressed in Machine Tags, which compromise three vital parts:
	- Namespace
		- Define the tag's property to be used
	- Predicate
		- Specifies the property attached to the data
	- Value
		- Numerical or text details to map the property

Tagging and Tagging Best Practices
- Tags are placed on events and attributes to identify them based on the indicators or threats identified correctly
- Allows for effective sharing of threat information between users, communities and other organisations using MISP to identify various threats
- Tagging at Event Level vs Attribute Level
	- Tags are inheritable when set
	- Recommended to set tags on the entire event and only include tags on attributes when they are an exception from what the event indicates
	- This will provide a more fine-grained analysis
- The Minimal Subset of Tags
	- The following are considered a MUST HAVE to provide a well-defined event for distribution
		- Traffic Light Protocol
		- Confidence
			- An indication as to whether or not the data being shared is of high quality and has been vetted so that it can be trusted to be good for immediate usage
		- Origin
			- Whether it was from automation or a manual investigation
		- Permissible Actions Protocol
			- Advanced classification that indicates how the data can be used to search for compromises within the organisation
