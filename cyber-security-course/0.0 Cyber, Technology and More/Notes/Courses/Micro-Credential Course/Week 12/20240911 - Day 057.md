- Regex: (adding some notes in relation to this topic, from this class, into the regex page in this repo)
	- https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/
	- the `^` and `$` are quite important - play around with this
	- Never trust user data/input - sanitise it and remove any characters that you deem not fit
	- logs 
		- referrer
			- The site/domain/ip that an HTTP request came from
		- don't forget about the `cut` command 
	- PCRE
		- Perl Compatible Regular Expressions
		- More advanced type of regular expressions
	- Programs that support regex
		- grep
		- egrep
		- fgrep 
			- search through strings
		- sed
	- Pattern matching
		- ie SIEM to match a rule that specifies/details what you're looking for
			- Looking for certain things
		- Or if you want to filter something out
		- pattern matching email addresses
		- A password field that has one or more numbers, or alpha-numeric characters
	- Filtering things out
	- Regex Python
		- And others
	- Formatting user input that is in-line with the system's design or requirements
	- NOT TRUSTING user input (generally speaking) 
	- 

- NGINX (to generate some logs)
	- Client -> Web Server -> 
	- Reverse proxy (refer to definition below)
	- 
- Web-servers by themselves can't process programmic language requests
	- IIS - Microsofts
		- Historically had pretty bad security
	- Apache
		- Basically speaks HTTP
		- When it took off the Apache foundation was created, its license was created
	- 2009'ish someone wanted to make a better version of Apache
		- A lot requirements for dynamic programming languages was required (php, perl, python and so on)
		- NGINX came into effect
- A typical proxy
	- Client > Proxy > Web-server 
- Reverse proxy
	- Client > Reverse Proxy (looks the same as a proxy, but works differently) > forwards request on to the programming language
	- NGINX
	- Traefik (implemented with GO)

- `grep` matches full lines where the pattern is matched

- globbing!
	- wildcarding with precision

People:
- “Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.”

Terminologies and Random Stuff:
- PERL was the first language to take off for dynamic websites
- Perl (.pl files)
- Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
	- tells the web server how to do things, how to run a program
	- A web request would come in, the web server would see what kind of request it was and forward it into a directory > /cgi-bin
	- cgi-bin
		- Where you'd put your scripts
		- like .pl scripts, .php scripts
- Python had created their own
	- WSGI
		- Web-server Gateway Interface
		- This would need to be implemented to create a Python web-server
	- ASGI
		- Asynchronous Gateway Interface
- Reverse proxy
	- Like NGINX
- A typical proxy
	- Client > Proxy > Web-server 
- Reverse proxy
	- Client > Reverse Proxy (looks the same as a proxy, but works differently) > forwards request on to the programming language
- Apache Tomcat
	- Java web application server
- /etc/passwd AND /etc/shadow
	- use vipw
		- vi password
		- loads up vi, edits either one of the above files, whatever you called
		- vipw -s 
			- for shadow file
		- vipw 
			- just by itself for the passwd file
		- creates a backup of the passwd/shadow file, then when you exit out it will copy the temp_backup into the main /etc/ location
- strace
	- system trace
- `env`
	- Have a look at this
- Defense in Depth 
	- A lot of layers set up to defend your system
- get into the habit of using `less` when opening files so as to not allow potential escape characters that could potentially be in that file

ToDo:
- Definitely go through teh notes above, reference them in the relevant vault pages
- Check out the faker python code
- Check out the code in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishnu0399/server-logs again
- Go through globbing
	- https://pymotw.com/3/glob/
- Go through the https://tldp.org/
