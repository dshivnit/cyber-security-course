- Defining Risk
	- The likelihood of a threat actor taking advantage of a vulnerability by using a threat against an IT asset
- Assets
	- Any part of an IT infrastructure that has value
		- Data
		- Equipment
			- Servers, Printers, Computer etc
		- People
		- Services
- Likelihood
	- The probability of assets being damaged over time
	- The probability of an event occurring over time
- Threat Actors
	- Anyone or anything with the motive and resources to attack another's IT Infrastructure
		- Hackers
		- Hacktivists
		- Script Kiddies
		- Insiders
		- Competitors
		- Shadow IT
		- Criminal Syndicates
		- Advanced Persistent Threat (APTs)
			- Long-term hacking of a system to gain information over time (extended)
- Vulnerabilities
	- Weakness inhered in the protection of an asset
- Threat
	- An action (exploit) by a Threat Actor that they can use against a Vulnerability to cause harm to an Asset
- Remediation
	- What Risk Management is ALL ABOUT! :D 
	- What do we do to to prevent the dangerous stuff above (Assets shouldn't be dangerous - unless you tie people and insiders together, then goodbad=bad)

- CIA Triad
	- Confidentiality\
		- Usually comes with forms of encryption
	- Integrity
		- Usually comes with the forms of hashing
	- Availability\
		- Making sure that systems are available when we need them

- Attack Vectors
	- Pathways to gain access to infrastructure
		- Weak configs
		- Open firewall ports
		- Lack of User security awareness
		- Lack of MFA
		- Missing patches
		- Infected USB thumbdrives
	- Supply-chain Attacks
		- Manufacturers
		- Contractorts
		- Implementers
		- Outsourced software development
			- Right-to-audit clause
			- To make sure that those developers/applications are compliant with regulations and security standards

- Threat Intelligence
	- Explain the different Threat Actors, Vectors and Intelligence Sources
	- Facilitate Risk Management
	- Hardening can reduce incident response time
	- Provide Cybersecurity insight:
		- Adversary TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures)
	- Threat Maps
		- Geographical representation of Malware Attacks
			- https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/
	- Threat Intelligence Sources
		- Closed/Proprietary
			- Signup Services
			- Paid-for Services
		- OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
			- Government Reports
			- Media Reports
			- Academic Reports
			- Google Open-source Hacking DB
			- File/Code Repositories

- Threat Intelligence Sharing 
	- Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)
		- Exchange of Cybersecurity Intelligence (CI) between entities
	- Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)
		- A form of AIS
		- Data exchange format for Cybersecurity Intelligence
	- Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)
		- Liks an RSS feed, but for threats
		- Consists of TAXII Servers and Clients
		- Real-time Cyber Intelligence feeds
