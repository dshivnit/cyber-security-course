- Network security is a set of operations for protecting data, applications, devices and systems connected to a network.
	- It is accepted as one of the significant subdomains of cyber security.
- Focuses on:
	- System design
	- Operation
	- and Management of the architecture/infrastructure to provide network:
		- accessibility
		- integrity
		- continuity
		- reliability
- The essential concern of Network Security focuses on two core concepts;
	- Authentication
	- Authorisation

Traffic Analysis
- A subdomain of Network Security
- Primary focus on investigating the network data to identify problems and anomalies
- Network security operations contain three base control levels to ensure the maximum available security management:
	- Physical Controls
		- Prevent unauthorised physical access to networking devices, cable boards, locks, and linked components
	- Technical Controls
		- Data security controls prevent unauthorised access to network data, like installing tunnels and implementing security layers
	- Administrative Controls
		- Provide consistency in security operations like creating policies, access levels and authentication processes
- There are two main approaches and multiple elements under these control levels. The most common elements used in network security operations are:
	- Access Control
		- The starting point of Network Security
		- It is a set of controls to ensure authentication and authorisation
			- Key Elements:
				- Firewall Protection
				- NAC - Network Access Control
					- Controls the devices' suitability before access to the network
					- Designed to verify device specifications and conditions are compliant with the predetermined profile before connecting to the network
				- IAM - Identity and Access Management
				- Load Balancing
					- Controls the resource usage to distribute (based on metrics) tasks over a set of resources and improve overall data processing flow
				- Network Segmentation
				- VPN - Virtual Private Networks
				- Zero Trust Model
					- Never trust, always verify
	- Threat Control
		- Detecting and preventing anomalous/malicious activities on the network
		- Contains both internal (trusted) and external traffic data probes
			- Key Elements:
				- IDS/IPS - Intrusion Detection System / Intrusion Prevention Systems
			- DLP - Data Loss Prevention
			- Endpoint Protection
			- Cloud Security
			- SIEM - Security Information and Event Management
			- SOAR - Security Orchestration Automation and Response
				- Technology that helps coordinate and automates tasks between various people, tools, and data within a single platform to identify anomalies, threats, and vulnerabilities
				- I also supports vulnerability management, incident response, and security operations
			- Network Traffic Analysis & Network Detection and Response

MSSPs - Managed Security Service Providers
- To keep a company's costs down, or to fill knowledge/skill gaps in their teams, company's may employ the services of an MSSP
	- Network Penetration Testing
	- Vulnerability Assessment
	- Incident Response
	- Behavioural Analysis
		- Organised approach to addressing system and user behaviours
		- Creating baselines and traffic profiles for specific patterns to detect anomalies, threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks

Traffic Analysis / Network Traffic Analysis
- A method of intercepting, recording/monitoring, and analysing network data and communication patterns to detect and respond to system health issues, network anomalies, and threats. 
	- Network Sniffing and Packet Analysis
	- Network monitoring
	- Intrusion Detection and Prevention
	- Network Forensics
	- Threat Hunting
- Flow Analysis
	- Collecting data/evidence from networking devices. This type of analysis aims to provide statistical results through the data summary without applying in-depth packet-level investigation
		- Advantage
			- Easy to collect and analyse
		- Challenge
			- Doesn't provide full packet details to get the root cause of a case
- Packet Analysis
	- Collecting all available network data. 
	- Applying in-depth packet-level investigation (often called Deep Packet Inspection - DPI) to detect and block anomalous and malicious packets
		- Advantage
			- Provides full packet details to get the root cause of a case
		- Challenge
			- Requires time and skillset to analyse
