- Linpeas
- SQLmap (skid)
	- Not allowed for most Certs
- Tools can change over time
	- Dependencies and further dependencies on tools that are being used
- C was made in the 1970s
- C++ in 1980s
- C++ 99 spec
- C++ 0x
- C++ 11 (released 2013. lel)
- C++ 14, 17, 20, 23
- Look up the history and the various variants from Microsoft etc
	- Now different flavours
- ECMAScript (and Javascript)
	- 5->6
- Compiling
	- Takes text (human-written code) and converts it into Binary
- Basic run in C
	- include stdio.h (standard input/output)
	- lel obfuscated code competitions
	- pointer (reference to a place/position in an address in memory)
	- cc "code.File" (to compile it, C Compiler)
	- defaults to a.out (file named a.out)
	- segmentation fault
- Always take note that C, C++ and C# are completely vastly different languages
- C# created by MS for their take on Java a while ago

- Python comment
	- """ comment """ !!! Never knew this (but then never really looked it up < _ < )

- Block
	- Lines of code
- Module
	- A file of code
- Package
	- a directory of code

- Compilers (programs when compiled) will leave meta tags in the output'd binary
	- These can be cleaned up prior to compiling or when issuing the compile
- Reproducible Builds
- Intel
	- Hardware compromises in regards to backdoors

- Running through Linux
	- File System Hierarchy

	- Symbolic Links
		- Shortcuts really
		- Soft Links
		- Hard Links

- /lib
	- Collection of programs made by others
	- clang and gcc 
	- ( gcc - GNU C Compiler, but can compile a bunch of other languages as well, via extensions - C++, fortran, ...)
		- C language
		- And some other languages (C++)
		- precompiled binaries or static files
			- Static binaries
		- include directory
			- contains code
			- text
		- lib directory
			- bunch of .so files (shared objects)
			- binary
				- Code that will be executed by the CPU
		- Text --> Binary --> CPU executes
- Be careful using 'cat' when running it on a binary file
	- Can get malicious code to run
- xxd "filename"
	- Hexedit/viewer of a binary file
- GNU Lib c
	- glibc runtime
	- If this gets updated, then a bunch of other applications/packages will need to be udpated as well most likely

ToDo:
- Go through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard again just to keep it more familiar (all the time)
- Symbolic Links
	- Review soft and hard 
- Go through **Terms and People** and research
- Go through bloody well everything above. LEL
- Go through the history of C and C++
- ECMAScript and Javascript
	- Run through the background
- Mindhunter
	- Check that out again :) 
- Film:
	- Zodiac
	- Check it out
	- cat 
- Check out some hexeditors similar to xxd in LinuxShell
- Look into Code Cave vulnerabilities more
- Look into the glibc runtime in further detail
- Jan Gullberg
	- Mathematics
	- Book: From the Birth of Numbers
- strings ("filename")
- Understand what is in /lib
	- someone elses code that we are linking to our program (if we're writing one per say)
- Differences between text and binary
- strings as well
- ELF format
	- Executable Link Format
- PE
	- Portable Executable
- Segmentation faults
	- Program crashes
		- What caused it? 
		- Worth noting
		- Worth documenting


- noted.
