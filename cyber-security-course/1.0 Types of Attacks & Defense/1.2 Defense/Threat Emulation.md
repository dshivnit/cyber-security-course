- Threat emulation is meant to assist security teams and organisations, in general, in better understanding their security posture and their defence mechanisms and performing due diligence in their compliance
- Ensures that the defense team can be provided with a perspective from the adversary's point of view without the hassle of actually having to deal with a threat with malicious intent

- Cyber Security Assessment Issues
	- Network owners and IT execs often wish to understand their cyber security effectiveness. They will usually line up with the following commonly asked questions:
		- Are our people trained and alert? 
		- Are our internal processes effective? 
		- Has the technology in use properly configured and delivered value to the business? 
	- These types of questions are normally addressed through cyber security assessments, mainly red team engagements, vulnerability assessments and penetration tests
	- Vulnerability assessments are conducted to identify vulnerabilities in assets under a defined scope
		- The focus here is comprehensive and based on the rules of engagement defined, as assessments do not include exploitation
	- Penetration testing involves exploiting vulnerabilities within an organisation under strict control of the scope and rules of engagement
		- Pentests provide organisations with information about their security posture, patching vulnerabilities and where to invest in security training or practices
	- Red Teaming provides a means of looking at cyber security issues from an adversary's perspective. 
		- This generates attacks on the organisation as though the actual adversary is attacking . 
		- This is done in the hope of making the defensive measures better and improving their detections
	- The challenge from these assessments is the lack of incentivisation of Red and Blue teams during engagements
		- No party wishes to share their intel and TTPs even when the benefits overlap for the both of them

Emulation vs Simulation
- Threat emulation is an intelligence-driven impersonation of real-world attack scenarios and TTPs in a controlled environment to test, assess and improve an organisation's security defences and response capabilities
- Threat simulation commonly represents adversary functions or behaviour through predefined and automated attack patterns that pretend to represent an adversary. This implies that the actions taken during the exercise will combine TTPs from one or more groups but not an exact limitation of a particular adversary 

- Threat emulation can be seen to have several key characteristics which line up well with the Pyramid of Pain. 
	- Real-world threats
		- The MITRE ATT&CK framework and cyber threat intelligence are common information sources to ensure threat TTPs are based on actual breaches, APTs and campaigns
	- Behaviour-focused
		- The execution of TTPs during an emulation exercise aims to tune defences based on behaviours and not signatures, thus adapting to the elements of the Pyramid
	- Transparency
		- Disclosure of activities between the Red and Blue teams during execution ensures that the security posture is improved holistically
	- Collaborative
		- Due to the common goal of improving organisational security, threat emulation allows teams to collaborate in their efforts
	- Repeatable
		- Some emulation tasks would be done multiple times in the course on an exercise or numerous exercises
		- These tasks can be automated, creating a baseline of continual practical security assessments and deployment

- Emulation can be applied to numerous instances, each with its own goals
	- Assessments & Improvement
		- The goal is to test personnel, assess security processes and evaluate the technology adopted
	- Capability Development
		- Emulation enables the creation, modification and application of tools and analytics derived from TTPs
	- Professional Development
		- Teaching and promoting knowledge sharing about adversary behaviours and frameworks
		- Breaks down the barriers between red and blue teams and fosters collaboration missions

- Threat Emulation
	- Intelligence-driven impersonation of real-world attacks
- Threat Simulation
	- Exercise of representing adversary functions through predefined and automated attack patterns
