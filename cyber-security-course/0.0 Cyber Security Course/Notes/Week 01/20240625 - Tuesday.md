##---------------------------------
- In business IT and IT Security there can be tradeoffs
- Engineers may make recommendations but then senior management may reject those recommendations > which can lead to issues/vulnerabilities/threats/attacks later
Ai, 
- Windows OS
	- Mark Russinovich in his teens, a bit of a hacker
	- Started to build these tools called Winternals > and then Sysinternals
	- Sysinternals is now a part of Microsoft (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/)

- Check RAM utilisation (memory utilisation)
- When a system runs there is the:
	- Boot process (comes from the Huckleberry Finn > he falls into a hole and he's told to get up by his bootstraps > he crouches down, grabs his boot and pulls his boot up, stands up and yanks himself out of the hole >> hence, boot up process)
	- Boot up process runs some code off the Motherboard first, then runs code off the Disk Drive (load this information, things that are going to allow I/O devices to speak with the OS that is loaded on to the drive) 
	- The OS will usually load itself into the lower/first bits of memory in RAM | This section is reserved for the OS
- Linux and BSD, Windows were all being developed in the 90s
- It was a good idea to protect the OS Code from being modified by other programs
	- **Protected Mode** Operating Systems
	- Forbid other programs from accessing other system's memory > unless they asked nicely
	- When writing code for an OS, and want to speak with the OS > using **SYSTEM CALLS** (syscall)
- Drivers used to cause issues as some of the drivers that were created could cause the OS to crash (in particular, Windows ) >> safe mode was a way to be able to prevent User Drivers from loading, and would load just bare bone drivers that came with the System (Safe-mode with or without Networking)
- From RAM there is a mapping to Virtual Memory VRAM
- Programs that are running on your computer don't interact directly with your RAM 
- One problem with the 32-bit OS's > the maximum amount of RAM you can refer to is 4GB
- You can use programs to see the mapping of Physical to Virtual Memory
	- The program "thinks" it has access to all Physical Memory > but it is an illusion **refer to MATRIX 2**
- You can run a **debugger** which allows you to intercept what the OS is doing and the communication between the program that is running in VRAM and the OS
- the OS runs on that reserved part of RAM, remember that and it speaks directly with the H/W on the MOBO
- You can figure out how Malware works when using a debugger
- Anti-debugging techniques as well
	- If you are writing a piece of software that people pay a license for
	- You can write code to prevent 'crackers' from doing modifying code by doing the same thing that they are doing - so you know what to build/develop to prevent that from happening

- Processes running on a computer/OS
	- **Parent processes**
	- **Child processes**
	- If a child process stalls/halts/fails > it becomes a **zombie process** > and what you do with zombie processes is you kill the process (terminate/end the process) (**kill process**)
	- **Fork**
		- Sometimes you may want to make a copy of the program as it is running at any given time and create a new 
	- **Fork Bomb** 
		- Run a program and fork and just do it forever
		- A sequence of characters
	- **ZIP Bomb**
		- Make the .zip file look small or no data > actually unzips a file that is GB's in size (or larger)
	- **XML Bomb**
		- Extended Markup Language 
		- MS Services uses a lot of XML for their configuration
		- XML's are just text files that are formatted in a specific way and expand  a series of instructions (from the .xml file) with the purpose of soaking up RAM
		- 
	- Denial of Service (DOS) Attack
	- Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) Attack

- An important SysCall is **malloc (memory allocate)**
	- When your system needs access to more RAM and it can't always deliver on that memory
	- There are a lot of bugs around that when some software runs a malloc command > and it asks for too much memory > the system will say NO > some programs don't check to see if there is sufficient memory to be able to make the malloc call 
	- What can happen when you are doing the Fork or XML Bombs, the software that is handling that file, asks for more memory and just keeps on asking for more and more memory > essentially making malloc calls
	- These days a lot of OS's will detect if a process/program is asking for too much memory and will end the process directly instead of completely shutting down or crashing
	- Memory leak
		- after asking for memory the program doesn't give it back to the OS
		- Ending up using more and more RAM 

- You can also freeze tabs in most standard web-browsers these days
	- Suspend a tab in Firefox releases those tabs from RAM and stores them in local storage
- **Spawn**
	- Creating a new process of the application from an existing processes of that application 

- Firefox
	- Shift-Esc > inbuilt debugger

- Linux
	- Tends to have processes use less RAM compared to other OS's like Windows

- **Lightweight Process**
	- Threads and Threading
	- Hyperthreading or Multithreading
	- Software thread
		- A copy of a process
		- But not a completely individual process on its own
		- It has some parts of the RAM of the Parent Thread shared
			- Considered a lightweight thread
- **Handle**
	- A virtual computer handle, that asks the OS to save something to storage or communicate something over a network
	- Can also be called a **File Descriptor**
- **Hyperthreading**
	- Context switching
	- Operating System Scheduling (process scheduling)
	- Trying to figure out the best way to allow for as many processes can be running as possible at any given time
	- **Elevators**
		- You can set priority's and CPU affinity (to select which CPU Cores will be dedicated to any particular PID)
- **RTOS (Real Time OS)**
	- It will run the program, and it will spend as much time as possible to run that program and it will not intercept or stall the program
		- For Mission Critical Applications
		- Tools such as Machine Cutting
		- Medical Machines
		- Production of Canned Goods
		- Military Applications
			- Guidance systems
			- Fighter jets
				- F-35
- x86 chips was the outcome from the 186, 286, 386, 486 > then x86
- AMD thought that people would need backwards compatibility when considering Server CPU Architecture
	- AMD64 > continues from the x86 (x86_64)

- CPU's tend to have:
	- Performance Cores
	- Energy-saving Cores
	- L1 / L2 / L3 caches
		- Some people question whether applications which are stored in cache are a backdoor that have been put there for some malicious purpose
		- There are applications that can scan for these
		- Rowhammer is a security vulnerability in DRAM
			- Rowhammer is **a security vulnerability in DRAM, enabling an attacker to change the data stored within memory cells**. Rowhammer attacks take advantage of the physical proximity of these cells within the memory array.
	- CPU's do what is called a **Look Ahead** (need to look into this further)
	- **Page File**

- Process Explorer
	- Can check TCP/IP connections
	- Can 
- CrackMe
	- Software that was designed by the programmer and a fun little 'thingy' for the sake of testing and learning

**Encryption Algorithms:**
- AES
- SHA256

**TLS**
- Performs Encryption in Transit
	- While your data is travelling from one node to another
	- The data is encrypted
	- OpenSSL library started firstly to handle just SSL > became a bigger library that handles a bunch of different stuff 
	- A security based library (used by a bunch of tools and software)

**DNS**
- Domain Name System
- Names corresponding to IP Addresses

**Firewall**


Checking for Malware
- Process Monitor
	- From SysInternals
	- Essentially running the suspected Malware and then probing to see which files and registry files are being accessed by that software/process
	- You can also right-click > "include" which will only show that one process/application's actions

Services.msc
	- Just make sure you're taking note of what you're disabling just in-case you break something

- Resistance to Change
	- Conservation of energy
	- People tend to not want to use that constant energy to learn something new

- Supply Chain Attack
	- Target the libraries that devs use
		- OpenSSL
		- Curl 
		- XZ (for Linux)
	- 
- Watering Hole Attack
	- Certain types of people go to certain websites
	- And if you're targeting those types of audience you can put up an ad for that kind of product/service
	- And if you're not blocking javascript from running then you can allow that kind of malicious code to run on your computer

- CAN Bus

- Device Manager
	- WIN+X > Device Manager
- Disk Management
	- Partitions
- Event Viewer
- Registry Viewer (RegEdit)
	- REG_SZ - String Zero
		- (Zero 0 > terminated in C language)
	- Backing up Registry
		- Export whichever registry you want to backup
		- 
	- HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT > corresponds to file extension types
		- (Linux and MacOS don't really care for file extensions)
		- Linux will look into the first few bytes of the file, and that will tell Linux what type of file it is and how it should be opened
		- Right click on to a Registry Parent Folder > Export > Have a look
			- 
	- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

##---------------------------------
TODO:
- Watch Matrix 2
	- Pending for when one has time, although noted

- Look up Fork
	- A fork is an operation whereby a process creates a copy of itself (child process) to carry out further functions independent of the parent process (the main process that had been cloned/forked from)
	- done
	
- Fork Bombing (also known as a Rabbit Virus)
		- Self-replicating child processes consume system resources, blocking legitimate programs from running and preventing the creation of new processes. During an attack, keyboard inputs (log out attempts for example) are ignored, essentially locking the system
		- done
		- HOW IS THIS DONE?!
		
- Look up ZIP Bomb
	- The “42. zip” is one of the largest and best-known zip bombs. When unopened, it appears to hold only 42 kilobytes of data. However, after decompressing, the file can expand to 4.5 petabytes (the equivalent of 4,500 terabytes). (taken from us.norton.com)
	- done

- Look up XML Bomb
	- A billion laughs... lel
	- done

- LOOK UP ALL THE BOMBS!
	- Bombed
	- done
	
- Look up further DOS and DDOS attacks
	- done

- Look into HANDLE's further (in processes)
	- done

- Look into Elevators and multithreading/hyperthreading
	- ..... did some research but I think Kris said we'll cover this again

- Look up the F-35 oxygen system cutting out to the pilot
	- In relation to RTOS (Real Time OS)
	- seperate todo has been set aside to check this out when one has time

- Configure Windows to make sure that shutdowns perform like a restart (clears all processes and states of the OS)
	- Control Panel > Hardware and sound >  Power Options > Change what power buttons do > Be in admin mode > turn off "Fast Startup" (so dumb)
	- done.
	
- Look up AMD64 and other CPU Architecture types
	- 
- Learning Tools:
	- Spaced Repetition 
	- ANKI (for learning and memory retention)
	- Noted, done.

- Change default downloads folder in Brave ...
	- done

Check out uBlock (origin)
	- done
	- Easy way to see ratings of various trackers/URL's that tap into a website you're looking at - pretty neat

Check out NoScript
	- done and working (can be annoying at first, until it makes you go o_O)
	- Works well with the Brave browser
	- WIP configuring Brave further.

---

STILL TO DO:
- Look into Rowhammer (to scan through rows of memory - in cache and RAM - vulnerability)
- Go through all the **BOLD** terms in the notes

-
- Check out the OpenSSL library in more detail
- Check out other Networking protocols (other than TCP/IP and UDP)
- Look into disabling Print Spooler service in Windows for hardening security
	
- Check out the attacks above
- Look up XZ Backdoor story
	- Set aside for a later date
- Check out CAN Bus
