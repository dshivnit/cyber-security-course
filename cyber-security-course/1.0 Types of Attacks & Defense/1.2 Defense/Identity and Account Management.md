Identification
- Claiming an identity
Authentication
- Proving that identity
- MFA
	- Using multiple ways/methods/factors to authenticate an account or login
	- Something you know
	- Something you have 
	- Something you are
- Attributes
	- Breaking down the factors
	- Something that you can do 
		- ie signature
	- Something you exhibit
		- ie typing speed
	- Someone you know
	- Somewhere you are
Authorisation
- Permitting specific actions or access once a User has been authenticated
- Determines resource permissions
- Resources
	- Files on a server
	- Rows in a database
	- A web-application
Accounting / Auditing
	Audit the activity of logins/sessions (what happened? When/Where/With?etc)
- Tied to authentication in that a user's activity is audited based on what a user has permission to do on a system
- Ensure each user has their own account (SEPARATE ACCOUNTS are key)
	- Resource access
	- Failed logon attempts
	- Changes to files/database records
- Logging

IAM - Identity and Access Management

- Authentication Methods
	- Usernames/Passwords
	- Password Managers
	- OTP
		- One-Time Password
	- TOTPs
		- Time-based OTPs
	- HOTP - HMAC-based OTP 
	- HMAC
		- Hash-based Message Authentication code
		- A specific type of message authentication code involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key
	- Certificate-Based Authentication
		- PKI certificates are issued by a CA to an individual entity
		- Device, VPN, app access
	- Can be stored on a smart card
			- Called a PIV
				- Personal Identity Verification
	- CACs
			- Common-Access Cards
	- SSH Public Key Authentication
	- Biometrics
		- Fingerprint scans
		- Retina scans
		- Iris scans
		- Facial recognition
		- Voice
		- Vein analysis
		- Gait analysis
			- How you move, walk
		- Efficacy Rates
			- False acceptance rate
			- False rejection rate
			- Crossover error rate
- Access Control Schemes
	- Credential Policies
		- Defines who gets access to what
			- Employees
			- Contractors
			- Devices
			- Service Accounts
				- Can be known as Managed Identities on platforms like Azure
			- Administrator/Root Accounts
				- PAM accounts (Privileged Access Management)
	- Attribute-Based Access Control
		- ABAC
		- Defining user or device attributes that can determine access to resources
			- Example DOB for a person wanting to get a drivers license
			- The version of a software before allowing or determining its access
	- Role-Based Access Control
		- RBAC
			- Defining roles which have access to resources
	- Rule-Based Access Control
		- Uses conditional access policies
		- In example, using MFA on an Android device, from New Zealand
		- Rules are applied
	- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
		- Assigning labels or identifiers to reources
			- files, network ports, databases and the such
		- Permissions are determined by resource labels and security clearance
	- Discretionary Access Control
		- DAC
			- The custodian of the resource sets the permissions at their discretion
	- Physical Access Control
		- Physical access vestibules
			- Fob key, locks on doors, gates, and so on
		- Limited physical access to buildings

- Account Management
	- Unique account per user
	- Organising users into groups
	- Principle of least privilege
	- User account auditing
	- Disabling accounts upon employee/user exits
		- Processing accordingly
	- Rights/privileges 
	- Account types
		- User, device, service
		- Admin/root
		- Privileged
		- Guest
	- Account Policies
		- Employee Onboarding
		- Password Policies
			- Complexity
			- Password History
			- Reuse
		- Account Lockouts
		- Time-based Policies
			- Enforce login/logout times
		- Geolocation Policies
			- Where is the login coming from
			- Where is the device located
		- Geofencing
			- User geolocation determines resource access
		- Geotagging
			- Adding location metadata to files and social media posts
		- Impossible travel time
		- Risky login
			- Time of login (abnormal time?)
		- Baselining User Activities
			- The common norm
	- Different types of user accounts can have different account policies applied
	- Each user should have their own account with only the permissions required to perform job tasks
	- Password policies control password complexity, history, and expiration
	- Assigning permissions to groups is scalable
	- Geofencing uses the device's physical location to determine resource access

- Network Authentication
	- PAP - Password Authentication Password
		- Don't use this, it's legacy
		- It sends cleartext transmissions of passwords
	- MS-CHAPv2
		- Microsoft Challenge Authentication Protocol
	- NTLM
		- New Technology LAN Manager
		- NTLMv2 uses salting
	- Kerberos
		- MS AD authentication
		- KDC
			- Kerberos Key Distribution Centre
		- AS
			- Authentication Service
		- TGS
			- Ticket Granting Service
		- TGT
			- Ticket Granting Ticket
	- Kerberos is used for Active Directory
	- NTLMv2 is used for Local Workgroup Computers
	- Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
		- used in Windows environments
		- used in VPN environments
		- Using PKI certificates, smart cards
		- EAP uses TLS as a transport mechanism
		-
