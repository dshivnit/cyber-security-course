- A comprehensive approach to **information security governance and regulation** is necessary to combat the evolving landscape wherein malicious actors relentlessly endeavour to exploit vulnerabilities in high-sensitive systems
- Such an approach requires establishing robust policies, guidelines and implementing rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance
- By adopting a proactive and strategic stance towards cyber security, organisations can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors and safeguard their sensitive systems against potentially catastrophic breaches. 

- Governance - managing and directing an organisation or system to achieve its objectives and ensure compliance with laws, regulations and standards
- Regulation - a rule or law enforced by a governing body to ensure compliance and protect against harm
- Compliance - The state of adhering to laws, regulations and standards that apply to an organisation or system

Information Security Governance
- Information security governance represents an organisation's established structure, policies, methods and guidelines designed to guarantee the privacy, reliability and accessibility of its information assets.
- It is essential for risk management, safeguarding confidential data from unauthorised intrusion, and adhering to pertinent regulations. 
- Information security governance falls under the purview of top-tier management and it includes :
	- Strategy
		- Developing and implementing a comprehensive information security strategy that aligns with the organisation's overall business objectives
	- Policies and Procedures
		- Preparing policies and procedures that govern the use and protection of information assets
	- Risk Management
		- Conduct risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organisation's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures
	- Performance Measurement
		- Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the information security governance program
	- Compliance
		- Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices

Information Security Regulation
- Governance and regulation are closely linked in the information security paradigm, but have distinct meanings
- Information Security Regulation
	- Refers to legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the use and protection of information assets
	- Regulations are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorised access, theft and misuse
- Compliance with regulations is typically mandatory and enforced by government agencies or other regulatory bodies
	- GDPR, PCI DSS, PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and more

Key Benefits of implementing governance and regulation
- More robust security posture
	- Implementing a comprehensive security governance program and complying with relevant regulations can help an organisation reduce the risk of security breaches and protect sensitive information from unauthorised access, theft and misuse
- Increased stakeholder confidence
	- Effective security governance and regulation can enhance stakeholder trust by demonstrating that an organisation takes cyber security seriously and has implemented measures to protect sensitive data
- Regulatory Compliance
	- Compliance with relevant regulations, like GDPR, HIPPA, PCI-DSS can help organisation avoid legal and financial penalties and reputational damage resulting from non-compliance
- Better alignment with business objectives
	- Security governance frameworks can help organisation align their information security strategies with their overall business objectives and ensure that security measures are cost-effective and contribute to the organisations success
- Informed decision-making
	- Security governance programs can provide decision-makers with the knowledge they need to make sophisticated decisions about information security risks and ensure that security measures are implemented where they are most needed
- Competitive advantage
	- Effective security governance and compliance with relevant regulations can provide a competitive advantage by demonstrating an organisation's commitment to protecting sensitive data and enhancing stakeholder trust

Relevant Laws and Regulations
- GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
	- Propagated by the EU that sets strict requirements for how organisations handle and protect and secure the personal data of EU citizens and residents
- HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
	- A US-based official law to maintain the sensitivity of health-related information of citizens
- PCI-DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
	- Set technical and operational requirements to ensure the secure handling, storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data by merchants, service providers, and other entities that handle payment cards
- GLBA - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
	- Financial companies must be sensitive to their customers' nonpublic personal information (NPI), including implementing information security programs, providing privacy notices, and disclosing information-sharing practices

Information Security Frameworks
- The Information Security Framework provides a comprehensive set of documents that outline the organisation's approach to information security and governs how security is implemented, managed, and enforced within the organisation. It mainly includes:
	- Policies
		- A formal statement that outlines an organisations goals, principles, and guidelines for achieving specific objectives
	- Standards
		- A document establishing specific requirements or specifications for a particular process, product, or service
	- Guidelines
		- A document that provides recommendations and best practices (non-mandatory) for achieving specific goals or objectives
	- Procedures
		- Set of specific steps for undertaking a particular task or process
	- Baseline
		- A set of minimum security standards or requirements that an organisation or system must meet

Developing Governance Documents
- Some generalised steps used to develop policies, standards, guidelines and so on
	- Identify the scope and purpose
		- Determine what the document will cover and why it is needed
		- For example - a password policy might be required to ensure robust and secure user passwords. In contrast, a baseline might be required to establish a minimum level of security for all systems
	- Research and review
		- Research relevant laws, regulations, industry standards, and best practices to ensure your document is comprehensive and up-to-date
		- Review existing policies, procedures, and other documents to avoid duplicating efforts or contradicting existing guidance
	- Draft the document
		- Develop an outline and start drafting the document, following best practices for writing clear and concise policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, and baselines
		- Ensure the document is specific, actionable, and aligned with the organisations goals and values
	- Review and approval
		- Have the document reviewed by stakeholders, such as subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams, and senior management
		- Incorporate their feedback and ensure the document aligns with organisational goals and values
		- Obtain final approval from appropriate stakeholders
	- Implementation and communication
		- Communicate the document to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing it
		- Develop training and awareness programs to ensure the document is understood and followed
	- Review and update
		- Periodically review and update the document to ensure it remains relevant and practical
		- Monitor compliance and adjust the document based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment

Preparing a Password Policy
- Define password requirements
	- Minimum length, complexity and expiration
- Define password usage guidelines
	- Specify how passwords should be used, such as requiring unique passwords for each account, prohibiting the sharing of passwords, and prohibiting default passwords
- Define password storage and transmission guidelines
	- Using encryption for password storage and requiring secure connections for password transmission
- Define password change and reset guidelines
	- How often passwords should be changed etc
- Communicate the policy
	- Communicate the password policy to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure that they understand the requirements and guidelines
	- Develop training and awareness programs to ensure that employees follow the policy
- Monitor compliance
	- Monitor compliance with the password policy and adjust the policy as needed based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment

Making an Incident Response Procedure
- Define incident types
	- Unauthorised access, malware infection or data breaches
- Define incident response roles and responsibilities
	- Identify the stakeholders, such as incident response team members, IT personnel, legal and compliance teams, and senior management
- Detailed steps
	- Develop step-by-step procedures for responding to each type of incident
	- Including  initial response steps, such as containing the incident and preserving evidence; analysis and investigation steps, such as identifying the root cause and assessing the impact; response and recovery steps, such as mitigating the incident, reporting and restoring normal operations
- Report
	- The incident to management and document the incident response process for future reference
- Communicate
	- The incident response procedures
- Review
	- And update the incident response procedures

- Organisations only sometimes need to make a standard, framework, or baselines; instead, they follow and use already made documents related to their field or discipline, as the financial sector may follow PCI-DSS and GLBA, healthcare may follow HIPPA and so on
- There are numerous factors from which a decision is made as to which standard framework of baseline checklist should be used - these include regulatory requirements primarily related to the particular geographical areas, scope, objectives, available resources, and more.
