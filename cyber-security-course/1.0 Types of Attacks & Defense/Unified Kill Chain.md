- Created by Paul Pols' in 2017
- Aims to complement, NOT compete, with other cybersecurity kill chain frameworks, such as the Lockheed Martin's one (Cyber Kill Chain) and MITRE's ATT&CK
- Establishing a good cybersecurity posture
- Understanding an attacker's motivation, methodologies and tactics
- Phases of the Unified Kill Chain
- A framework that is used to complement other frameworks such as MITRE

- Kill Chain
	- A methodology/path that attackers use to approach and intrude a target
- Objective is to understand an attacker's "Kill Chain" so that defensive measures can be put in place to either pre-emptively protect a system, or disrupt an attacker's attempt. 

- Threat Modelling
	- A series of steps to ultimately improve the security of a system.
	- Identifying risk, and essentially boils down to:
		- Identifying what systems and applications need to be secured and what function they serve in the environment
		- ie - is the system critical to normal operations, and is a system holding sensitive information related to PCI or PII
	- Assessing what vulnerabilities and weaknesses these systems and applications may have and how they could be potentially exploited
	- Creating a plan of action to secure these systems and applications from the vulnerabilities highlighted
	- Putting in policies to prevent these vulnerabilities from occurring again where possible 
	- Threat modelling is an important procedure in reducing the risk within a system or application
	- It creates a high-level overview of an organisation's IT assets and the procedures to resolve vulnerabilities
	- Can help identify potential attack surfaces and how these systems may be exploited
	- Some frameworks used in Threat Modelling:
		- STRIDE
			- Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege
		- DREAD
			- Risk Assessment model
			- Quantitative method of calculating the severity of a threat using a scaled grading system so that high severity concerns can be addressed first
		- PASTA
			- Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis
		- CVSS
			- Common Vulnerability Scoring System
			- Public framework for rating the severity and characteristics of security vulnerabilities in information systems
	- 18 Phases:
		- Reconnaissance
			- Researching, identifying and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance
		- Weaponisation
			- Preparatory activities aimed at setting up the infrastructure required for the attack
		- Delivery
			- Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponised object to the targeted environment
		- Social Engineering
		- Exploitation
		- Persistence
		- Defense Evasion
		- Command and Control
		- Pivoting
		- Discovery
		- Privilege Escalation
		- Execution 
		- Credential Access
		- Lateral Movement
		- Collection
		- Exfiltration
		- Impact
		- Objectives
