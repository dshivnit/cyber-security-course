- Roaring Kitty
	- Crypto investor 
		- Did a bunch of due diligence (Reddit)
- AWSALB - Application Load Balancer
- AWSALBCORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
	- Sticky sesions
		- These get sent to a Load Balancer (1, 2, 3, 4, as many depending on how many LBs they have)
- su in unix/linux : substitute user || switch user || I call it super user
	- -u : switch user
- ubuntu
	- Canonical is the company behind the Ubuntu team
	- archive.ubuntu.com
- Subdomains
	- Searching up subdomains of a particular URL to see various subdomains that they have
- Adrian Lamo
	- Look him up where you can
- Chelsea Manning
- .gz - GZIP
- .xz - another form of compression
	- Better compression algorithm
	- Someone added a backdoor to it
- .gpg - pgp 
- Cryptowars
- GNU - 
- GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPGP)
- Attribution
	- You could be imitating anyone
		- example:
			- On 29 March 2024, software developer Andres Freund reported that he had found a maliciously introduced backdoor in the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6. 0 and 5.6. 1 released by an account using the name "Jia Tan" in February 2024. (wikipedia)
	- Mannerisms, local dialect, etc (nek minnit, doggos, idjit etc)
- WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux
- less and more commands in Linux
- CLI's can be more than useful if your network connection isn't great, and sometimes even when it is compromised (in some relation to DOS attacks/evets)
- Dont' have SMS as your 2FA authentication
- Don't even use 2FA... Use MFA.. <_<
- DIG - Domain Information Groper
	- A : does an A lookup
- Cloudflare Lavalamp
	- Proxy requests that go through to your website
- Website proxies through Cloudflare say for example and then to where it needs to go
	- So there is an intermediary point for connections to go through before either host/client
- Cloudflare are a bit of a monopoly now and can dictate terms
	- A gambling site getting a bill for $100,000
		- Site kept on getting attacked
		- Cloudflare said that they weren't going to keep defending them as they kept getting attacked so pay up
		- lol
- Dev Tools (Web Dev Tools - F12 will bring this up automatically) 
	- Network Tab
		- Shows what has been loaded sequentially
- Web Sockets (ws) (look this up further)
	- Regular http transfer
- wss (WebSocketSecure)
		- https transfers
- check out intercom.io
- pubsub
	- Publish Subscribe
		- Pushing data out to multiple nodes
		- Use of channels
	- everything after is a parameter
- Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking
- HTTP/2 check it out
- svg file - Scalable Vector Graphics
		- look into vector graphics and how they scale (pretty interesting)
		- WHen compared to pixels and pixelation!
		- Also check on to SVG Vulnerabilities
- AmazonS3 - S stands for Storage
	- Lets you upload a bunch of files and toggle permissions on those files
	- Storage is called a Bucket
	- The Canada trucker protests
- curl command curl 
- Windows has been backwards compatible with various releases since 3.1 
	- Printer and Font services have not had a lot of eyes on them for secvul's 
		- Someone a while back found a series of critical vulnerabilities in relation to fonts
			- So if an attacker were to inject a malicious font set into a system 
				- It would show an irregularity on how 
- packetstormsecurity.com 
- VMs in play/sand/test mode
	- Heap 
		- When the application process needs to do a large amount of processing it will ask the OS to do a malloc (memory allocation request) > the OS if it allows, will give them that
			- Heap Corruption
			- Ends up processing the malicious code as opposed to the original code
	- Stack
		- Easiest way to organise memory
		- Like Stackoverflow website
		- When the application needs to process something in real-time or quite quickly, and needs to store parameters inside that function, is when it will use STACK
			- Normally takes a little chunk of memory
- NGFW - Next Generation Firewall
- Bicep - MS's equivalent to Terraform
- ARM templates - from Amazon

- TODO
	- Elaborate on subdomains in relevant section
	- Adrian Lamo
		- Look him up where you can
		- The homeless hacker
	- Kevin Mitnick
	- Chelsea Manning
	- Check out backports (to shell code/updates) and see how this is relevant to Ubuntu and other distros
	- Check these out:
		- .gpg - pgp 
	- Cryptowars
	- GNU - 
	- GNU Privacy Guard
	  - less and more commands in Linux
	  - Have a look through the description table items in man man (the manual of man, the manual) :) 
	  - /etc/passwd
		  - check to see for hashing :) 
	  - dig 
	  Cloudflare Lavalamp
	- Proxy requests that go through to your website
	- Web Sockets (look this up further)
	- check out intercom.io
	- pubsub look it up in further detail
	- Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking look this up
	- HTTP/2 check it out
	- svg file - Scalable Vector Graphics
		- look into vector graphics and how they scale (pretty interesting)
		- WHen compared to pixels and pixelation!
		- Also check on to SVG Vulnerabilities
	- ifconfig.me 
	- curl - command-line url 
		- look this up futher
		- /ua user-agent
		- spoofing your webbrowser say for example when accessing a system that only accepts particular webbrowser set
		- curl -H "user-agent: whatever/1.0" ifconfig.me/ua
			- will return the device 'whatever/1.0' being detected

			- Normally takes a little chunk of memory
				- Look in to the above memory vulnerabilities
	- Rest  language
		- Representational state transfer
			- Get
			- Put
			- Post
			- Delete
		- Rest API usually refers to the get, put, post, delete
	- HATEOS
	- Legacy Code (ie jQuery)
		- ES6 standard (look that up in comparison to Legacy)
	- Terraform for AWS (IaC - Infrastructure as Code - config file language, in a text file, how you want your cloud system to look)
		- Look into this further
