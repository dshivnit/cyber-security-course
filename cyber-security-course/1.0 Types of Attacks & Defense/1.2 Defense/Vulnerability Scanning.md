- Patching - Remediating a vulnerability

Vulnerability Scanning and Types:
- The inspection of systems to find weaknesses
- An important compliance requirement of many regulatory bodies
- Some security standards advise to perform vulnerability scanning quarterly, while some advising to perform it once a year
- The bigger the network, the slower the process of manual vulnerability
	- Note, that is if you are doing the scans manually
- Efficient Vulnerability Scanners are available on the market that can automate the scanning process
- If any vulnerabilities are found, then the Team(s) involved can patch them
- Major categorisations of Vulnerability Scanning (amongst other types)
	- Authenticated vs Unauthenticated Scans
		- Authenticated Scans
			- Require a hosts credentials and are more detailed than unauthenticated scans
			- Helpful for discovering the threat surface within the host
			- Identifies vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers having access to the host
			- Provides deeper visibility into the target system by scanning its configuration and installed applications
			- Example:
				- Scanning an internal database by providing its credentials to the vulnerability scanner
		- Unauthenticated Scans
			- Conducted without providing any credentials
				- Only needs an IP address
			- Exposes vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host
			- Less resource-intensive and straightforward to set  up
			- Example:
				- Scanning a public-facing website for vulnerabilities that any user can exploit
	- Internal vs External Scans
		- Internal Scans
			- Carried out within a network
			- Focuses on vulnerabilities that can be exploited internally 
			- Identifies vulnerabilities that would be exposed to attackers once they have been able to penetrate the internal network/system
		- External Scans
			- Conducted from outside of the networks
			- Focuses on vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside
			- Exposes vulnerabilities that the attacker could exploit from outside the network
- Authenticated and Internal scans go hand in hand, and the same goes for Unauthenticated and External scans

Some Tools for Vulnerability Scanning
- Nessus
	- Developed as an open-source project in 1998
	- Later acquired by Tenable in 2005 and became proprietary software
	- Extensive vulnerability scanning options and is widely used by large enterprises
	- Available in both free and paid versions
	- Free offers a limited number of scans features
	- Commercial offers advanced scanning features, unlimited scans, and professional support
	- Needs to be deployed and managed on-prem
- Qualys
	- Developed in 1999 as a subscription-based vulnerability management solution
	- Along continuous vulnerability scanning, it can provide compliance checks and asset management
	- Automatically alerts on vulnerabilities found during continuous monitoring
	- Cloud-based platform
	- No extra cost or effort to keep it up and running on physical hardware to manage it
- Nexpose
	- Developed by Rapid7 in 2005 as a subscription-based vulnerability management solution
	- Continuously discovers new assets in the network and performs vulnerability scans on them 
	- Gives vulnerability risk scores depending on the asset value and the vulnerabilities impact
	- It also provides compliance checks against various standards
	- Offers both on-prem and hybrid solutions
- OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)
	- Open-source vulnerability assessment solution developed by Greenbone Security
	- Offers basic features with known vulnerabilities scanned through its database
	- Less extensive than commercial tools
	- Gives you the flavour of a complete vulnerability scanner
	- Useful for small organisations and individual systems

CVEs and CVSS
- CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
	- a CVE is a unique number for each known vulnerability and/or exposure that has been identified
	- Tracks how the vulnerability has been rectified, what systems it has/had impacted, which organisations/suppliers were involved and also the teams/people who had taken part of providing a POC (Proof Of Concept) and a solution
- CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scoring System
	- Low - 0.0-3.9
	- Medium - 4.0-6.9
	- High - 7.0-8.9
	- Critical - 9.0-10
