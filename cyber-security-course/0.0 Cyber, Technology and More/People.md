	- The Gutmann Wipe Method
		- An algorithm for securely erasing the contents of computer hard disk drives. (it achieves a complete erase of the disk contents by repeatedly writing 35 segments in the sectors to be erased)
		- However, the Gutmann method (according to the Information Security Stack Exchange) is no longer useful for modern devices, whether it be a harddrive or a solid state drive. (wear leveling is irrelevant). 
		- For any modern drive, the best way to erase data on it is to wipe it once with a random pattern. 
		- SED and TRIM are the way to go when wanting to wipe an SSD (*may want to look into this more*)
