- Motivational Triggers
	- The backbone of social engineering lies in the ability of an attacker to trick a user into doing something for them
	- Authority
		- The power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience
		- If an attacker pretends they are someone of authority, they may be able to influence employees deemed to be at a 'lower-level' to do what they want
			- Say for example, in order to please a client we need to ... x
		- Mimicking being someone from a government body, like the IRS (IRD)
			- The Police
			- Some body of authority
	- Urgency
		- Compelling sense of immediacy or time-sensitivity that drives individuals to act swiftly or prioritise certain actions
		- Most people want to be helpful
		- Attempts by threat actors to create a sense of urgency to get the organisation's employees to ignore or bypass their normal security procedures
			- And then, be able to gain access to their systems
	- Social Proof
		- Psychological phenomenon where individuals look to the behaviours and actions of others to determine their own decisions or actions in similar situations
		- People crave to be a part of a social group
		- Inherent need to feel included
			- Social proof - this system is "credible" look at how many likes it has, look how many shares it has, look how many awesome reviews it has. 
				- Has to be good!
	- Scarcity
		- Psychological pressure people feel when they believe a product, opportunity or resource is limited or in short supply
		- Much like urgency
		- But there is a limit to something that is stated - and that limit is getting smaller by the minute say for example
	- Likeability
		- Associated with being nice, friendly, and socially accepted by others
		- Drawing people into a sphere of influence
		- To gain people's trust
		- Being attractive
		- Sexual attraction
		- Pretending to be a friend
		- Common interest
	- Fear
		- Feeling afraid of someone or something, as likely to be dangerous, painful or threatening
		- Fear
		- Authority
	- These motivations can be overlapped together to achieve an effective social engineering campaign
	- Social engineers manipulate users with motivational triggers to execute malicious actions
