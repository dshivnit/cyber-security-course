- Unit Testing
	- Using VisualStudio Code in this iteration
	- Writing a simple program that takes some user input, does a calculation, then returns a value based on the user input that was provided
	- Python has a library called unit test 
		- pytest
		- Will search for files in a directory that starts with "`test_*`" and run them
	- Make function names as descriptive as possible within files that start with `test_`
		- ie 
		- `import calculator`
		- `def test_0_salary_returns_0_tax():`
		- `assert calculator.tax_calc(0) == 0`
	- Assert command
		- Try to run this command, and if you fail at running this command, stop the program execution completely
	- the pytest library when installed, changes the behaviour of the assert command, by allowing the code to keep running after a failure of a command
		- The function above `test_0_salary_returns_0_tax()` is a unit test function
	- `pytest` would then be run in the same directory of the code files
	- **Test Driven Development**
		- **Writing unit tests before writing the actual code**
	- Your tests are only as good as the code that is within the tests
		- The tests themselves have to be accurate, and 'good'
