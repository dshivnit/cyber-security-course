- Guest lecturer/speaker
- Keeping scheduled tasks/routines to a minimum to a workstation
	- ie Firewall Rules
- Cron Jobs
	- Logs
	- Backups
- Having a central node (or distributed 'central nodes') that probe other Servers for their state, and
- Python versions 2.x have a different syntax used when printing (keep that in mind just incase you come across that variant later)


Python Stuff:
- `import sys`
- `print(sys.argv)`
- sys.argv is a list in Python that contains all the command-line arguments passed to the script
- Now, bear in mind that sys.argv is a list (double check this but the one that has square backets as opposed to brackets) that always starts with 0 which will print by default the file name that the function is being called from. Say for example, example.py
- The `sys` module provides functions and variables which are used to manipulate different parts of the Python Runtime Environment 
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html
- `which awk`
	- Will print out where the awk file (program) lives
- `xxd $(which awk) | head -n 2`
	- Will find out what the data file type is, ELF say for example
- ` export PATH="$(pwd):$PATH"`\
	- export the current working directory out to PATH!
- Think back to the bash script that you made and do more practice. lol 
- imports
	- argpass
	- client
		- The above two amongst others will have 

- Commenting
	- Code smell
	- When comment intents aren't matching what the code is doing
	- Using comments like
		- TODO
		- XXX
		- FIXME
			- Can identify code/comment that needs to be updated

ToDo:
- refer to the client and server Python scripts made 
- keep practicing bash scripting just bashing in general (well zsh, similar)
- vim THM 
- tmux THM
- Practice with sys.argv
- 

`import sys`
