GENERAL NOTES
- Interest rates from the Reserve Bank of NZ have settled a bit
- AWS (NZ) restart course have 30 seats to fill in their IT Support wing 
	- Dila/Kris/Education_team are looking into getting our Team in where they can
- 65-70% go into a placement
- Some previous students have since gone to Rocket Lab (promotions twice due to concepts topics learnt in this course)
- Kris is keen to get people into roles

- Boot To Root
	- A type of challenge where you have a VM (which you know nothing about) you have to do all the recon and research yourself
	- You'll be given an IP address
	- NMAP tool being used etc
	- Figure out what services are running on it
	- Essentially trying to find exploits to get into it as root
	- THM
- THM Machines/Rooms
	- Many of the systems/rooms are community created
	- Which can depict a lesser quality when compared to HTB scenarios which are made by official members of their Team
- CTFs coming up soon
	- DownUnder (happening this weekend)
	- Different types of challenges (depending on who sets it up)
	- Offense vs Defense
	- For larger teams
		- Both teams have to do both offense and defense
	- Jeapordy
		- You get given the answer
		- Need to figure out what the question is
	- 
	
##------------
PYTHON (named after Monty Python!)
- Covering Python 
- Lists
	- Use squared brackets
- Tuple
	- Use the round paranthesis
	- Same as the list, but you can't modify them
		- Such as appending items, etc
- Containers
	- Set
	- Dictionary
- Sets
	- Uses curly brackets from what I've seen
	- Set is an unordered collection of things WITHOUT duplicates
	- Python will automatically remove duplicates from a set.
	- Important methods you can use on sets are: add, difference, intersection, union
	- Operations
		- Intersection
			- When you have two different objects, the intersection operator will give you this (imagine if you had two circles overlapping with each other - the overlap will be the intersection)
		- Union
			- Combination of both sets
			- Removes duplicates
		- Example:
			- set_a = { 'Apple', 'Banana', 'Carrot', 'Banana' } # duplicate gets removed
			- set_b = { 'Carrot', 'Date', 'Elderberry' }
	- Operator overloading ( funny example, thanks Kris - person 1 + person 2 )
		- Tells Python to create one of two data types
- Dictionaries
	- Dictionaries are a key-value object in Python.
	- Liek sets, you create them using curly brackets, but unlike sets, they must be created as key-value pairs using the colon symbol
	- The values used can be any object. 
		- my_dictionary = { 'banana': '$10.00', 'cheese': True } # see what's happening here? : ) 
- Conditionals/Control Flow Basics
	- IF ( boolean expression ): # anything following the IF call is called an 'expression'
		- followed by ELSE # if nothing in the if expression was true
		- or ELIF ( boolean expression ): # if you have to run another IF statement
	- You don't really need else and elifs, it's up to whatever you're trying to do yao
- Looping Basics
	- WHILE Loop
		- WHILE ( boolean expression ): 
			code
	- BREAK
		- if you want to break out of a loop early 
	- CONTINUE 
		- continue from next iteration of the loop
	- PASS
		- do nothing here, continue through here
		
	- FOR Loop
		- for something in my_list:
			print( something )
		- for i in range( 1, 10 ):
			print( i )
	- MATCH # to cover later
	- ENUMERATE( ) # to cover later
	- List comprehensions # to cover later
- pip ( pypi.org) 
	- security@python.org 
		- W
	
- Back a little to Data Types:
	- Static Typing
		- Think of an integer/number which doesn't have decimal points
		- A float is a number that does have a decimal point
		- A string can be a sequence of characters (an individual character, a number a number or a punctuation symbol etc)
	- Complex Types
		- Think of the different kinds of equipment needed in a drum kit (snares, kicks, symbols, crash symbol, china symbol etc)
		- A grouping of data, information
		- Up to the programmer to decide what to call it
		- Joining multiple types together to create a whole new type
	- Dynamic Types
		- Python and Javascript are like this
		- You don't have to be explicit when constructing a data type
		- 
	- Container Types
		- List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set
		- You can take the above and make a completely new kind of "type" 
- SDLC - Software Development Lifecycle
	- Planning
	- Analysis
	- Design
	- Implementation
	- Testing and Integration
	- Maintenance

RANDOM STUFF
- Open Webcam websites
	- When you buy cameras, quite often those devices can not be secured
	- Websites exist from where you can see feeds from around the world
		- Ukraine war recently, massive lines seen withdrawing monies from ATM's etc
	- Traffic feeds 
	- That kind of thing
- When you install drivers, software sometimes have to be installed at a modular level to speak with with the kernel
	- Razer  had an exploit wherein they were able to gain root access just by plugging in a USB mouse!
- C++ meta template programming
- Web development codes
	- React
	- TypeScript
- Static Typing
- Haskell proglang  - doesn't have looping
- Spotify pay a fraction of what could've been 0.25 cents per stream now
	- Faking streams by using the Spotify Streaming service (Kris will link this through to us)
		- How long does someone have to listen to a stream to get pay from Spotify for?
			- Clark has mentioned 30seconds
			- Blair/Josh mentioned that swearing/cursive language in the first 8 seconds and Spotify demonitise you
	- Think about how to be able to counter people being exploit fraudulent streams
		- What can the company do, to be able to counteract these kinds of exploits
- Josh - background UX design
	- That is User Experience
	- Empathising with the end-user and finding out proper use-cases, desired experiences as opposed to making assumptions and jumping straight into development
		- Imo - use-case design is very important
- Blair - YouTube Music in comparison to Spotify (plenty of media found on there that won't be found on other platforms/services)
- Randle (Matthew) - Spotify doesn't have much of a social aspect to it
- Josh - LastFM! Used to be the social community, where you could record your listening hours and share them with other people
- Kris - with algorithms set in play, message boards not really common like they used to be, people are being suggested content based on algorithms as opposed to what they or perhaps their social networks are interested in or are looking/listening to at the moment (or even in the past)
- YouTube has been adding extra elements to their URLs now (for tracking)
	- Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&pp=ygUJcmljayByb2xs
	- Everything from and after the & symbol have been added that acts as a tracker
	- YouTube can track the relation between all of us (who share that link to others)
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ = clean version
- Example:
	- https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=FqRVbKX4np33cUoa
	- Everything before the ? symbol is all you need
	- Everything after it has data around what systems/applications you are currently using
	- FB
		- has something like fb_clkid
	- InstaGram
		- has something like igshid 
			- or something like this
	- Whether you are logged in or not

- Expand on the SDLC  > will be good to touch on this again as a lot of software development companies and companies in general (with Project Management etc) will use a similar structure in their planning for systems
	- Use Cases, Activity diagrams
		- The scenario/context of the activity, searching for something? Does this come at a cost? How will that run? What would an end-user want to experience this? Different audiences. Do people need to get paid? Describe their use-cases, activity diagrams. Run some prototype tests. 
	- Also consider piracy for the service/product
		- How will that be combated
		- How can that be exploited? 
	- Expand on the above, as this can be something that will be common-place depending on the type of role/learning/career path you want to go on
