- Aims to introduce security at every stage of the SDLC
- Research at IBM in their Systems and Sciences Institute discovered that it would cost six times more to fix a bug during the implementation phase of the SDLC - than one that was identified as early as during the design phase. 
	- It also had identified that it would cost 15 times more if the flaws were found during testing, and up to 100 times more if found during the maintenance and operation phases. 
- Faster development
- Reduction of costs
- Assists in discovering and reducing the vulnerability count early 
	- Thus reducing business risk significantly
- Examples:
	- Architecture analysis during design
	- Code review and scanners during development
	- Conducting security assessments (pentests) before deployment

- Security is a constant concern, which can improve quality and security of the software constantly 
- Boosting the education and awareness of security allows all stakeholders to know each phase's security recommendations and requirements
- Flaws would be detected early - before deployment.
	- Reducing the risk of getting hacked, or disruptions
- Costs would be reduced, speed would increase - due to detecting vulnerabilities and the resolution to said vulnerabilities, early.
- Business risk, reputation damage, and fines that could lead to economic disaster for a company would be prevented
