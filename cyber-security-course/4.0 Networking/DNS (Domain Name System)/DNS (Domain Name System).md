 *Expand with more topics here as there is plenty from Day004 and on the topic in general..*

- Operates on the 7th Layer (Application Layer)
- Uses UDP Port 54 by default
- TCP Port 53 as a default fallback
 
- DNS
	- Domain Name System
	- Provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the Internet without remembers complex numbers (ie IP Addresses v4/6)
- Top-Level Domain (TLD)
	- ccTLD (Country Code Top-Level Domain)
		- .nz
		- .au
		- .us
	- gTLD (Generic Top-Level Domain)
		- .com
		- .biz
	- The last bit in a URL/Domain Name
- Second-Level Domain
	- example.com (example here would be the Second Level Domain name) 
	- Limited to 63 characters
	- Only the use of a-z, 0-9 and hyphen characters (cannot start or end with hyphens nor have consecutive hyphens, sorry Mr Hyphen)
- Subdomains
	- Presented to the left of the Second-Level Domain in a given full domain name
	- Has the same creation restrictions as the Second-Level Domain
	- Limited to 63 characters and the same restrictions as a SLD, well second level domain

- DNS Root Servers
	- DNC - Domain Name Commission(er)
	- BIND
		- To host your own DNS Servers
	- DNS Records:
		- MX Record
			- Mail Exchange Record (ie mail.example.tld)
			- For email handling
		- A Record
			- A name to an IP address 
		- AAA Record
			- A name to an IPv6 address
		- CNAME
			- Canonical Name
			- Fancy term that means it's a name pointing to another name
				- if there isa full-stop at the end of this with nothing after it, it will tell the resolver to stop
				- Otherwise you get a continuous loop that can happen (because the process hasn't been told to stop/die/get-killed)
			- SOA
				- Start Of Authority
	- DNS Anonymization
		- Instead of directly responding to clients, a resolver can act as a transparent proxy to another resolver, hiding the real client IP to the latter. 
		  Anonymized DNSCrypt, specifically designed for DNS traffic is a lightweight alternative to running DNSCrypt through Tor and SOCKS proxies. (from Wikipedia)
	- DNS Root Server
		- DNS nameservers that operate in the root zone. 
		- DNS Root Servers can directly answer queries for records stored or cached within the root zone, and they can also refer other requests to the appropriate Top Level Domain (TLD) server. (CloudFlare)
	- Top Level Domain (TLD) Name Server
		- Represents the first stop after the root zone. 
		- Is everything that follows the final dot (.) of a domain name. 
		- Example: google.com = .com is the TLD
	- RIPE
		- **Ensuring the uniqueness of Internet number**Â resource usage through registration of information related to the resources and their Registrants and Maintainers (RIPE INR)18 Dec 2023
	- DNSCrypt (https://www.dnscrypt.org/)
		- A protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic singatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and haven't been tampered with. 
		- (free and open-source implementations - not affiliated with any company or organisation)
	- TTL - Time to Live
	- DIG - Domain Information Groper
	- NIC (in the context of DNS)
		- Network Information Centre
- DNS Record Types 
  *just note taking for the most part here, these sections will be revised at a later date so as to reduce redundancy, I understand that these types/elements have been discussed just above*
	- A Record
		- Resolve a "name" to an IP address on the Internet (the human-readable website name pointing to an IP address on the Internet)
		- Maps a hostname to one if not more IPv4 addresses
	- AAAA Record
		- Similar to above but relating to the direction to IPv6 addresses as opposed to IPv4
	- CNAME Record
		- Canonical name (that word always seems interesting to me, Canonical)
		- Records that resolve to another domain name
		- ie shops.myshop.com --> store.myshop.com 
		- Another DNS request would then resolve the pointed-to's actual A Record and IP Address
	- MX Record
		- Mail Exchange Address
		- Handles the email queries for the domain that one would be querying
	- TXT Record
		- Free text fields
		- Multiple uses
		- Common ones:
			- List servers that have the authority to send an email on behalf of the domain (can help in the battle of spam and spoofed emails)
			- Verify the ownership of the domain name when signing up for third party services
