Terminologies
- KYC - Know Your Customer
- PII - Personably Identifiable Information
	- D/L's, CC's etc
- CoW
	- Copy on Write
- Transactions
	- No in-between state between the program completing its instruction and prior to executing/starting it's instruction
	- In the event there was a power-cut, the code will either retract whatever it did and start again
		- Banking transactions for example
- System Enclave
	- Software would need to be encoded 
- SDA 
	- Sata Device (named A)
- EBS
	- Elastic Block Store
		- io1 
		- gp3
		- gp2
- Terraform
- Infrastructure as Code
	- IaC
	- Defining the infrastructure, system specs, in code or in a file (as opposed to having the physical hardware itself) 
	- Virtual
- Deprecated Manifest Versions in Web-Browsers

ToDO:
- For the sake of knowledge
	- Go through the various known and used (even from before) filesystems
- Go through strace, and some of the Linux concepts above and play around a bit more with logging
- https://expeditedsecurity.com/aws-in-plain-english/
- Look into SDAs in drives more
	- Serial Data and so on what? 
- AWS terminologies
- Deprecated Manifest Versions in Web-Browsers
