- GUI
	- Desktop
		- Display Settings
	- Start Menu
	- The Taskbar
	- Notification Area
		- (Or System Tray)
- File System
	- NTFS
		- New Technology File System 
		- Before NTFS
			- Fat16/Fat32 (File Allocation Table)
			- HPFS (High Performance File System)
			- FAT in use in USB devices, MicroSD cards etc
		- Known as a journaling file system
		- In thee event of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on the disk using information stored in a log file
			- This functionality is not available on FAT file systems
		- Addresses many issues that the FAT filesystem had:
			- Supports files larger than 4GB
			- Set permissions for specific folders and/or files
			- Folder and file compression
			- Encryption (EFS or Encryption File System)
		- Permissions
			- Full Control
				- Folder / File = what do you think
			- Modify
				- Folder
					- Permits reading, writing, of files and subfolders, allows the deletion of the folder
				- File
					- Permits reading/writing of file, deletion of the file
			- Read & Execute
				- Folders
					- Viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well of executing of files (inherited by files and folders)
				- Files
					- Viewing and accessing of a files contents, executing of a file
			- List Folder Contents
				- Folders
					- Viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well as executing of files, inhered by folders only
				- Files
					- Bruh
			- Read
				- Folders
					- Viewing and listing of files and subfolders
				- Files
					- Permits viewing or accessing of the files contents
			- Write
				- Folders
					- Permits adding of files and subfolders
				- Files
					- Permits writing to a file
		- **ADS**
			- Alternate Data Streams
			- File attribute specific to NTFS
			- Every file has at lease one data stream ($DATA) 
				- The contents of a .txt file
				- Executable code in a .exe file
				- Also referred to as the "unnamed data stream"
			- ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data
			- Natively, WinExplorer doesn't display ADS to the User
			- There are third party exe's that can be used to view this data
			- Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files
			- An ADS must be named
				- Note that $DATA for the file will remain unchanged if there are ADS's added
			- Add a colon at the end of the file name and extension along with the name of the ADS
				- example: test.txt:stream2
			- MACs make use of two streams per file
				- One for data
				- One for resource information
			- Since NTFS supports multiple streams, a MAC file could be copied on to a Windows Server and back again without losing the resource stream
			- Archive Management and Backup Software use ADS to store file revision information
			- Web Browsers add a stream to files downloaded from the Internet that includes security information about where the file came from
			- Adversaries can misuse ADS for malicious purposes such as malware attacks
				- Similar to a unknown compartment in a suitcase used by a smuggler to smuggle something across borders or by inspection officers
			- ADS can be used to hide code and execute future attacks while skirting basic sec utility detection 
			- ADS can store any type of file, audio, video, images, code
			- ADS are hidden, users wouldn't be able to detect them when using directory indexing or listing commands
			- Tools to gain visibility of ADS
				- Echo and More
				- Sysinternals Streams utility
				- /R option of dir in command-line
				- PowerShell 3.0
					- has six cmdlets to directly manipulate content for ADS

	- Then, your main account, ensure it isn't in the Administrators Group
	- Simple, and basic. Do it if you're reading this and haven't done so already
	- Same goes for your Linux builds, any builds. (You do not want the main account you'll be playing with/in to be an admin, period.)
	- :)

	- Drive encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and address the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.
	- Provides the most protection when used with a TPM v1.2 or later.
	- If a device doesn't have TPM 1.2 or later, then a USB Startup Key would be needed
- VSS - Volume Shadow Copy Service
	- Coordinates the required actions to create a consistent shadow copy (a snapshot) of the data to be backed up
	- Stored in the System Volume Information folder on each drive that has the protection enabled
		- Create a restore point
		- Perform system restore
		- Configure restore settings
		- Delete restore points
	- From a security perspective - malware writers know of this Windows feature and write code in their malware to look for these files and delete them. 
		- Doing so makes it impossible to recover from a ransomware attack unless you have an offline/off-site backup.

- https://tryhackme.com/r/room/btwindowsinternals
	- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/user-mode-and-kernel-mode
	- User Mode
		- Each application is provided with a private virtual address space where other user applications that are running can not manipulate or access one another's virtual-memory/address space
	- Kernel Mode
		- Also assigned a virtual private address but the difference is that kernel-mode drivers aren't isolated from other drivers or the OS. 
		- If a kernel-mode driver accidentally writes to the wrong virtual address, it could compromise the data belonging to the operating system or another driver
		- If a kernel-mode driver crashes, it causes the entire OS to crash

				- Session 0 (an isolated Windows session for the OS):
					- csrss.exe
					- wininit.exe 
				- Session 1 (user-session)
					- csrss.exe
					- winlogon.exe
			- The first child instance creates new child instances in new sessions, via smss.exe copying itself into the new session and self-terminating
			- Any other subsystem listed in the `Required` value of `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Subsystems` is also launched
			- Also responsible for creating environment variables, virtual memory paging files and starts winlogon.exe
		- **csrss.exe**
			- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client/Server_Runtime_Subsystem
				- Lives in:
					- %SystemRoot%\System32\csrss.exe

				- Number of instances:
					- Two or more
				- User Account
					- Local System
					- NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
			- Client Server Runtime Process
			- The user-mode side of the Windows Sub-System
			- Always running, a critical process
			- Responsible for the WIn32 console window and process threat creation and deletion
				- For each instance a:
					- csrsrv.dll
					- basesrv.dll
					- winsrv.dll 
					are loaded, along with others.
			- Also responsible for making the Windows API available to other processes, mapping drive letters, and handling the Windows shutdown process. 
		- **wininit.exe**
				- Lives in 
					- \System32
				- Parent process is 
					- smss.exe (remember it kills its instance shortly after starting wininit.exe)
				- Number of instances
					- one
				- User Account
					- Local System
					- NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
			- Windows Initialisation Process
			- launches within Session 0

					- Local System
					- NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
				- 
			- Handles system services
				- loading services
				- Interacting with services
				- Starting and stopping services
			- Maintains a database that can be queried using a Windows built-in utility, `sc.exe`
			- Information regarding services stored in registry is located in:
				- `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services`
			- This process also loads device drivers marked as auto-start into memory
			- Upon successful user logon, services.exe is responsible for setting the value of the "Last Known Good" control set (Last Known Good Configuration) to that CurrentControlSet
				- `HKLM\System\Select\LastKnownGood`
			- `services.exe` is the parent of other key processes:
				- `svchost.exe`
				- `spoolsv.exe`
				- `msmpeng.exe`
				- `dllhost.exe`
		- **wininit.exe > services.exe > svchost.exe**
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svchost.exe
				- Path
					- %systemroot%\system32\
				- Parent:
					- services.exe
				- Number of instances:
					- MANY!
				- User Account: 
					- Varies
					- (SYSTEM, Network Service, Local Service)
					- Depends on the svchost.exe instance
					- Win10 sometimes the instances may run as the logged-in user
				- Image
			- Service Host 
				- Host Process for Windows Services
			- Responsible for hosting and managing Windows services
			- The services that run in this process are implemented as DLLs
			- The DLL to implement is stored in:
				- `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\'SERVICE-NAME'\Parameters`
					- `ServiceDLL` subkey
			- When looking at various services in ProcessHacker (SystemInformer) take note of a services properties
				- The binary path will always have a `-k` in it
				- Showing that it is a legitimate `svchost.exe` process that is called
			- `-k` parameter
			- `C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k DcomLaunch -p`
				- Grouping similar services to share the same process
				- Concept was based on the OS design and implemented to reduce resource consumption
				- Started from Win10 v1703
				- Services grouped into host processes changed
				- For machines that run on more than 3.5GB of memory, each service will run its own process
			- Since `svchost.exe` will have multiple running processes on any Win system, this process has thus been made a target for malicious use.
				- Adversaries will create malware to masquerade as this process and try to hide amongst the legitimate svchost.exe processes
				- They can name the malware svchost.exe or misspell it a little, like `scvhost.exe`
				- Trying to get under the radar essentially
				- Another tactic is to install/call a malicious service (DLL)

			- It uses authentication packages specified in
				- `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`
			- Another target for adversaries
				- **mimikatz** can be used to dump credentials, or threat actors may mimic this process to hide in plain sight
					- Changing the spelling of the malicious service/program only slightly

			- Userinit.exe exits after spawning explorer.exe
				- Meaning that the parent-process is non-existent :) 
			- explorer.exe will have numerous child-processes
