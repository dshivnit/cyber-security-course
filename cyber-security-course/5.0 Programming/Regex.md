- Regular Expressions
- Tools for finding or matching patterns in strings.
- Special sequences used to find or match patterns in strings. 
- These sequences use metacharacters and other syntax to represent sets, ranges or specific characters. 
	- ie `[0-9]` matches the range of numbers between 0 and 9
	- ie `humor|humour` matches both of the strings given, being 'humor' and 'humour'
- Basics:
	- Expressions start and end with a `/`
		- The below examples may not include these .. 
	- Metacharacters
	- Character sets
		- `[bcf]at` - would mean that the characters within the square brackets would be included when searching strings for `*at` 
	- Ranges
		- `[a-z]at` - would include the entire alphabet when searching a string for `*at` 
		- Can be partial ranges, capitalised ranges, number ranges, symbol ranges
			- `[a-f]` or `[g-p`]
			- `[A-Z]`
			- `[0-9]`
			- `[!@#$%]`
		- Mixed
			- `[a-zA-Z0-9]`
		- A four letter word:
			- `[a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z]`
			- `[a-z]{4}`
		- A word with four letters or more
			- `[a-z]{4,}`
		- A word between 2 and 4 letters
			- `[a-z]`
		- Note that a range only specifies multiple alternatives for a single character in a pattern
	- Special characters
	- Flags
		- `g` - global
			- Don't return after first match
		- `i` - case-insensitive
			- Case insensitive match
		- `m` - multi-line
			- `^` and `$` match start/end of line
		- `y` - sticky
			- Anchor to start of pattern, or at the end of the most recent match
		- `u` - unicode
			- Match with full unicode
		- `v` - vnicode
			- Enable all unicode and character set features
		- `s` - single line
			- Dot matches newline
		- `d` - indices
			- The regex engine returns match indices
	- Expressions start with `/` and end with `/` 
	- Flags would go at the end of an expression
	- ie `/word/g`

- Practical applications of Regex:
	- Form input validation
	- Web scraping
	- Search and replace operations
	- Filtering information from large text files (such as LOGS!)
- Terminologies:
	- pattern
	- string
	- digit
	- letter
	- symbol
	- space
	- character
- Tools:
	- Regex101
	- Essential for experimenting with regex patterns in a supportive environment.
	  - Building and testing patterns to ensure desired criteria is matched
