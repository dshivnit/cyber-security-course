Python
- Socket stuff
- Can create a
	- Client
	- Server
	- Proxy
- Installing pipx
- Checking for
	- bpython
	- ptpython
- IF YOU NEED To add to PATH after trying to run bpython and/or ptpython:
	- for zsh
		- first configure ~/.zshrc (or .bashrc, or whatever depending on the shell you are running)
		- Add the below to the bottom of the file
		- `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
	- load it
		- `source ~\.zshrc`

- `bpython`
- Typically the way one will work is to use IDE's like bpython so that you can test code on the fly whilst transferring what you've written (and is working) into a proper script file (with editors like VIM etc) 
	- Then running those scripts to make sure they're working as they should be
	- `bpython`
	- `ctrl+l`
		- Will bring the bpython session to the top of the screen
		`import socket
	 	`server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`
	 	`server_socket.bind("localhost", 6969)`
		`server_socket.bind(("localhost", 6969))`
		`server_socket.listen()`
			- There is a service that can act as a proxy between connections if the service above is running as root
			- `cap_net_bind` service can be set in place if needed
			- This isn't really needed in today's time though
	- Set up a client to connect to the server above
		- Can use netcat, nc initially for the sake of testing
		- Send something
	- Server-side
		 `client1, addr1 = server_socket.accept()`
		 `client1`
				`<socket.socket fd=10, family=2, type=1, proto=0, laddr=('127.0.0.1', 6969), raddr=('127.0.0.1', 36056)>`
		 `client1.send(b"test message")`
			 This will then send out to the client side
		 `client1.send(b"\n\n\x41\x42\x43")`
			 Will send this in hex, the client side will receive
			 ABC
		 `client1.send(b"\n\n\x48\x45\x4C\x4C\x4f`") 
			 Will send this in hex, the client side will receive
			 HELLO
	 - Client-side
		 send something in the nc listener that was set up by typing something :) 
	 - Server-side
		 - `client1.recv(1024)` (set 1024 bytes to be received)
			
Python
- Tuple Unpacking (also referred to as Tuple Pairing)
	- `mylist = [1, 2, 3]`
	- `x, y, z = mylist`
	- `print(x)`
	- 1
	- `print(z)`
	- 3
- `pip install cryptography`
- 

- Vim
	- `shift + zq`
		- exit without saving
	- `shift + zz`
		- Test this lol
	- `bb`
		- back a word
	- `w`
		- forward a word
	- `Shift` w b etc and give it a go 
	- Also `:` can run shell commands, say for example `pwd` 
	- `vimtutor` 
		- Check it out
- `o`
	- Insert a line below
- `O`
	- Insert a line above

- Discord and MD language formatting:

- `ctrl+d` 
	- Will send an EOF (end of file) to the program and close out of it
- `ctrl+c` 
	- Will send a SIGINT 
		- An interrupt which will force close the application 

- Creating a Virtual Environment via python
	- create a directory for the VE
	- `python -m venv myvenv`
	- Activate it
	- `source myvenv/bin/activate`

TODO:
- ![[HEX_Table.png]]
- Remove this and add it where it belongs linking out to the image that will be in the online Repo
	- woo
- Example below for MD formatting to include Python code as required: 
``` Python
import socket

```
