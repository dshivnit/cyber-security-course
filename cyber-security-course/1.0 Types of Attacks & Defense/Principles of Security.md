Defense in Depth
- The use of multiple varied layers of security to an organisation's systems and data in the hopes that multiple layers will provide redundancy in an organisation's security perimeter 

- The CIA Triad
	- A security model that is used in consideration throughout creating a **security policy**
	- Been in use since 1998
	- Industry standard
	- Helps determine the value of data that it applies to, and in turn, the attention it needs from the business
	- A continuous cycle
	- The three elements can arguably overlap, if even just one element is not met, then the other two are rendered useless
	- If a security policy does not answer these three sections, then it is seldom an effective security policy

	- Confidentiality
		- The protection of data from unauthorised access and misuse
		- Protect data from parties that it is not intended for
	- Integrity
		- The condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorised changes are made
		- Integrity is maintained when the information remains unchanged during storage, transmission and usage not involving modification to the information 
		- Steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorised people
		- Access control and rigorous authentication can help prevent authorised users from making unauthorised changes. 
		- Hash verifications and digital signatures can help ensure that transactions are authentic and that files have not been modified or corrupted
	- Availability
		- In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user
		- Information and data should be available when authorised users need access to it
		- Often a key benchmark for an organisation
		- For example, having 99.99% of uptime on websites or systems (as laid out in SLAs (Service Level Agreements)). 
		- When a system is unavailable, it often results in damage to an organisations reputation and loss of finances
		- Achieved through a combination of elements, including
			- Reliable and well-tested hardware for IT servers (reputable servers)
			- Redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the primary
			- Implementing well-versed security protocols to protect technology and services from attack
