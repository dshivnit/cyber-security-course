 - Protocols:
	 - SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
		- Utilised to handle the sending of emails
		- SMTP Secure Port: 587 (formerly 465)
	- POP3 (Post Office Protocol)
		- Responsible for transferring emails between a client and a mail server
		- Emails are downloaded and stored on a single device
		- Sent messages are stored on the device from which the email was sent
		- If you want to keep messages on the server, ensuring to have the "Keep Mail on the Server" is enabled
			- Else all messages are deleted from the server once downloaded on to the single devices email client
		- POP3 Secure Port: 445
	- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
		- Responsible for transferring emails between a client and a mail server
		- IMAP Secure Port: 443

- How an email is sent:
	- Sending mail client
	- SMTP server
	- DNS server
	- back to the original SMTP server
	- Through a firewall
	- Over the Internet
	- Through another Firewall
	- SMTP server
	- POP3/IMAP server
	- To the Receiving mail client
	
- Email Headers:
	- Information about the email - such as the email servers that relayed the email
	- Email messages use the syntax known as IMF (Internet Message Format) 
	- Basic Header:
		- From
		- Subject
		- Date
		- To
	- Raw/Full Headers
		- Can be pulled from the email client one is using (process is client version/developer dependent)
	- How to analyse an Email Header
		- NOTE: every line can be forged when reading an Email Header
		- ONLY the received lines that are created by your service or computer should be trusted.
		- Run the headers (full/raw version) in MXToolbox or something similar (however, MXToolbox is awesome :) ) and review the RECEIVED section or trust that in comparison to the rest
	- Custom Email Headers
		- Starting with "X-"
			- are custom headers the sender can add
			- The X prefix is usually to denote that the header is not official or standardised, as what the IETF does
				- The IETF are the Internet Engineers Task Force
					- They create the technical standards that make up the Internet Protocol suite. 
			- These custom headers often provide additional information or metadata about the email, such as
				- tagging the email for spam filtering
				- sorting purposes
				- adding information specific to a particular organisation or system

- Email Body
	- Either in plain-text or in HTML
	- Can also view the source of the message
		- If there are attachments then you can see details around the attachment
			- Content-Disposition:
			- Content-Transfer-Encoding:
			- Content-Type:
		- Always be careful to not just open any random (and or any) attachment
		- 
- IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
	- The standard that emails generally follow is defined by the IETF
		- Specifically RFC 5322
			- Which specifies the syntax and semantics of email messages
		- RFC 2045-2049
			- which defines the MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards for email messages on the Internet
