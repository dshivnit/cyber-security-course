- A comprehensive approach to **information security governance and regulation** is necessary to combat the evolving landscape wherein malicious actors relentlessly endeavour to exploit vulnerabilities in high-sensitive systems
- Such an approach requires establishing robust policies, guidelines and implementing rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance
- By adopting a proactive and strategic stance towards cyber security, organisations can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors and safeguard their sensitive systems against potentially catastrophic breaches. 

- Governance - managing and directing an organisation or system to achieve its objectives and ensure compliance with laws, regulations and standards
- Regulation - a rule or law enforced by a governing body to ensure compliance and protect against harm
- Compliance - The state of adhering to laws, regulations and standards that apply to an organisation or system

Information Security Governance
- Information security governance represents an organisation's established structure, policies, methods and guidelines designed to guarantee the privacy, reliability and accessibility of its information assets.
- It is essential for risk management, safeguarding confidential data from unauthorised intrusion, and adhering to pertinent regulations. 
- Information security governance falls under the purview of top-tier management and it includes :
	- Strategy
		- Developing and implementing a comprehensive information security strategy that aligns with the organisation's overall business objectives
	- Policies and Procedures
		- Preparing policies and procedures that govern the use and protection of information assets
	- Risk Management
		- Conduct risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organisation's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures
	- Performance Measurement
		- Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the information security governance program
	- Compliance
		- Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices

Information Security Regulation
- Governance and regulation are closely linked in the information security paradigm, but have distinct meanings
- Information Security Regulation
	- Refers to legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the use and protection of information assets
	- Regulations are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorised access, theft and misuse
- Compliance with regulations is typically mandatory and enforced by government agencies or other regulatory bodies
	- GDPR, PCI DSS, PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and more

Key Benefits of implementing governance and regulation
- More robust security posture
	- Implementing a comprehensive security governance program and complying with relevant regulations can help an organisation reduce the risk of security breaches and protect sensitive information from unauthorised access, theft and misuse
- Increased stakeholder confidence
	- Effective security governance and regulation can enhance stakeholder trust by demonstrating that an organisation takes cyber security seriously and has implemented measures to protect sensitive data
- Regulatory Compliance
	- Compliance with relevant regulations, like GDPR, HIPPA, PCI-DSS can help organisation avoid legal and financial penalties and reputational damage resulting from non-compliance
- Better alignment with business objectives
	- Security governance frameworks can help organisation align their information security strategies with their overall business objectives and ensure that security measures are cost-effective and contribute to the organisations success
- Informed decision-making
	- Security governance programs can provide decision-makers with the knowledge they need to make sophisticated decisions about information security risks and ensure that security measures are implemented where they are most needed
- Competitive advantage
	- Effective security governance and compliance with relevant regulations can provide a competitive advantage by demonstrating an organisation's commitment to protecting sensitive data and enhancing stakeholder trust

Relevant Laws and Regulations
- GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
	- Propagated by the EU that sets strict requirements for how organisations handle and protect and secure the personal data of EU citizens and residents
- HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
	- A US-based official law to maintain the sensitivity of health-related information of citizens
- PCI-DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
	- Set technical and operational requirements to ensure the secure handling, storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data by merchants, service providers, and other entities that handle payment cards
- GLBA - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
	- Financial companies must be sensitive to their customers' nonpublic personal information (NPI), including implementing information security programs, providing privacy notices, and disclosing information-sharing practices

Information Security Frameworks
- The Information Security Framework provides a comprehensive set of documents that outline the organisation's approach to information security and governs how security is implemented, managed, and enforced within the organisation. It mainly includes:
	- Policies
		- A formal statement that outlines an organisations goals, principles, and guidelines for achieving specific objectives
	- Standards
		- A document establishing specific requirements or specifications for a particular process, product, or service
	- Guidelines
		- A document that provides recommendations and best practices (non-mandatory) for achieving specific goals or objectives
	- Procedures
		- Set of specific steps for undertaking a particular task or process
	- Baseline
		- A set of minimum security standards or requirements that an organisation or system must meet

Developing Governance Documents
- Some generalised steps used to develop policies, standards, guidelines and so on
	- Identify the scope and purpose
		- Determine what the document will cover and why it is needed
		- For example - a password policy might be required to ensure robust and secure user passwords. In contrast, a baseline might be required to establish a minimum level of security for all systems
	- Research and review
		- Research relevant laws, regulations, industry standards, and best practices to ensure your document is comprehensive and up-to-date
		- Review existing policies, procedures, and other documents to avoid duplicating efforts or contradicting existing guidance
	- Draft the document
		- Develop an outline and start drafting the document, following best practices for writing clear and concise policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, and baselines
		- Ensure the document is specific, actionable, and aligned with the organisations goals and values
	- Review and approval
		- Have the document reviewed by stakeholders, such as subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams, and senior management
		- Incorporate their feedback and ensure the document aligns with organisational goals and values
		- Obtain final approval from appropriate stakeholders
	- Implementation and communication
		- Communicate the document to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing it
		- Develop training and awareness programs to ensure the document is understood and followed
	- Review and update
		- Periodically review and update the document to ensure it remains relevant and practical
		- Monitor compliance and adjust the document based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment

Preparing a Password Policy
- Define password requirements
	- Minimum length, complexity and expiration
- Define password usage guidelines
	- Specify how passwords should be used, such as requiring unique passwords for each account, prohibiting the sharing of passwords, and prohibiting default passwords
- Define password storage and transmission guidelines
	- Using encryption for password storage and requiring secure connections for password transmission
- Define password change and reset guidelines
	- How often passwords should be changed etc
- Communicate the policy
	- Communicate the password policy to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure that they understand the requirements and guidelines
	- Develop training and awareness programs to ensure that employees follow the policy
- Monitor compliance
	- Monitor compliance with the password policy and adjust the policy as needed based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment

Making an Incident Response Procedure
- Define incident types
	- Unauthorised access, malware infection or data breaches
- Define incident response roles and responsibilities
	- Identify the stakeholders, such as incident response team members, IT personnel, legal and compliance teams, and senior management
- Detailed steps
	- Develop step-by-step procedures for responding to each type of incident
	- Including  initial response steps, such as containing the incident and preserving evidence; analysis and investigation steps, such as identifying the root cause and assessing the impact; response and recovery steps, such as mitigating the incident, reporting and restoring normal operations
- Report
	- The incident to management and document the incident response process for future reference
- Communicate
	- The incident response procedures
- Review
	- And update the incident response procedures

- Organisations only sometimes need to make a standard, framework, or baselines; instead, they follow and use already made documents related to their field or discipline, as the financial sector may follow PCI-DSS and GLBA, healthcare may follow HIPPA and so on
- There are numerous factors from which a decision is made as to which standard framework of baseline checklist should be used - these include regulatory requirements primarily related to the particular geographical areas, scope, objectives, available resources, and more.

Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC)
- The GRC framework focuses on steering the organisation's overall governance, enterprise risk management, and compliance in an integrated manner. 
- It's a holistic approach to information security that aligns with the organisation's goals and objectives and helps to ensure that the organisation operates within the boundaries of relevant regulations and industry standards. 
- It has the three following components:
	- Governance Component:
		- Guiding an organisation by setting its direction through information security strategy, which includes policies, standards, baselines, frameworks (and so on) along with establishing appropriate monitoring methods to measure its performance and assess the outcomes
	- Risk Management Component:
		- Identifying, assessing, and prioritising risks to the organisation and implementing controls and mitigation strategies to manage those risks effectively. Includes monitoring and reporting on risks and continuously evaluating and refining the risk management program to ensure its ongoing effectiveness
	- Compliance Component
		- Ensuring that the organisation meets its legal, regulatory, and industry obligations and that its activities align with its policies and procedures. This includes developing and implementing compliance programs, conducting regular audits, and assessments, and reporting on compliance issues to stakeholders

Generic Guidelines on Developing a GRC Program:
- A well developed and implemented GRC program for cyber security provides an integrated framework for managing risks, complying with regulations and standards, and improving the overall security perspective of an organisation. 
- Define the scope and objectives
	- Determining the scope of the GRC program and defining its goals
	- A company can implement a GRC program for its customer data management system for example
		- The objective might be to reduce cyber risks to 50% in the next 12 months while maintaining a trust of its customers
- Conduct a risk assessment
	- The organisation identifies and assesses its cyber risks. 
	- A risk assessment might reveal that the customer data management system is vulnerable to external attacks due to weak access controls or outdated software for example
		- The organisation can then prioritize these risks and develop a risk management strategy
- Develop policies and procedures
	- Developed to guide cyber security practices within the organisation
	- The company might establish a password policy to ensure the usage of strong passwords
	- They might also implement logging and monitoring system access procedures to detect suspicious activity
- Establish governance processes
	- Ensure that the GRC program is effectively managed and controlled
	- The organisation might establish a security steering committee that meets regularly to review security risks and make decisions about security investments and priorities
	- Roles and responsibilities are defined to ensure everyone understands their role in the program
- Implement controls
	- Technical and non-technical controls are implemented to mitigate risks identified in the risk assessment
	- The company might implement firewalls, IPSes, IDSes, and SIEMs to prevent external attacks and impart employee training to improve security awareness and reduce the risk of human error
- Monitor and measure performance
	- Processes are established to monitor and measure the effectiveness of the GRC program 
	- The organisation can track metrics and compliance with security policies for example
		- This information is used to identify areas for improvement and adjust the program as needed
- Continuously improve
	- The GRC program is constantly reviewed and improved based on performance metrics, changing risk profiles, and stakeholder feedback.
	- Suppose that the organise experiences a security incident
		- It might conduct a post-incident analysis to identify the root cause and make changes to prevent a similar incident from happening again.

NIST 800-63B
- A set of guidelines created by the NIST to help organisations establish effective digital identity practices
- Primary focus is on authenticating and verifying the identities of individuals who access digital services, systems and networks
- Provides recommendations for different levels of identity assurance, ranging from basic to high assurance. 
- Offers advice on authentication factors, including passwords, biometrics, and tokens, and securely managing and storing user credentials

Information Security Management and Compliance
- Strategic planning, execution, and continuous administration of security measures
- Protects information assets from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, interruption, alteration, and destruction
- Involves risk assessment and identification, security controls and procedures development, incident response planning, and security awareness training
- Observing information security-related legal, regulatory, contractual, and industry-specific standards

ISO/IEC 27001
- Internationally recognised standard for requirements to plan, develop, run, and update an organisation's Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- The official documents are paid for. Developed by the ISO and the IEC
- Has these components:
	- Scope - specifies the boundaries, including covered assets and processes
	- Information security policy - a high-level document defining an organisation's information security approach
	- Risk treatment - Selecting and implementing controls to reduce the identified risks to an acceptable level
	- Statement of Applicability (SoA) - specifies controls from the standard which are applicable and the one's that are not
	- Internal audit - Involves conducting periodic audits of the ISMS to ensure that it is operating effectively 
	- Management review - review the performance of ISMS at regular levels
- An ISMS built on the ISO 27001 standard requires careful design and execution
- Entails exhaustively evaluating the organisations security procedures, detecting gaps, and conducting a thorough risk assessment 
- Leadership support and resource allocation are also essential for the ISMS to be implemented successfully 
- Regular monitoring, measurement, and continual development are crucial to guarantee the efficacy and continued alignment of the ISMS with the organisation's objectives

Service Organisation Control 2 (SOC2)
- Developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as a compliance/auditing framework
- Focuses on assessing the efficacy of a company's data security based on the CIA triad
- Can reassure customers, stakeholders, and business partners that the company has put sufficient controls in place to safeguard its systems, data, and sensitive information
- Essential for service providers interacting with client data or offering solutions that process, store, or transmit sensitive data
- Assists businesses in demonstrating their dedication to upholding strict privacy and security standards
- Customers frequently ask for SOC 2 reports or use them as a competitive advantage to guarantee clients that their information will be handled securely

- SOC2 is an auditing standard that evaluates the usefulness of a service organisation's controls related to confidentiality, availability, integrity, and privacy
- Independent auditors conduct SOC2 audits to determine that security controls meet the relevant criteria
- SOC2 reports provide valuable information to customers, stakeholders, and regulators on a service organisation's security and privacy practices
	- They can be used to demonstrate that the service organisation has adequate controls to protect the data and systems it uses to process customers' information 
	- Example - a cloud computing company providing infrastructure services to other businesses may undergo a SOC2 audit to demonstrate its adequate controls to protect customer data stored on its servers
	- The audit may cover physical security, network security, data encryption, backup and recovery and employee training awareness
	- The SOC2 audit report will assess the controls in place at the cloud computing company and include any findings and/or recommendations for improvement
	- The information can be shared with customers and other stakeholders to ensure the company takes appropriate measures to protect its data and systems
