- Third-party Vendor Risks
	- Potential security and operational challenges introduced by external entities (vendors, suppliers, or service providers)
	- When we integrate external partners into our operational ecosystem, we open up the avenues to potential threats and vulnerabilities 
		- That could affect our company's integrity, data security and overall business continuity
	- Some of what it could be:
		- a hardware provider who's components have vulnerabilities
		- A software supplier who's application has a hidden backdoor
		- Or a service provider, like a MSP, that has access to sensitive data - but lacks rigorous cyber security protocols

	- Domain 2.3 - Explain various types of vulnerabilities
	- Domain 5.3 - Explain the processes associated with third-party risk assessment and management

- Supply Chain Risks
	- Understanding and mitigating supply chain risks is a really big consideration for cyber security professionals
	- Potential vulnerabilities
		- Hardware manufacturers
		- Software developers
		- Service providers
	- Hardware Manufacturers
		- Consider a router or a switch
			- It becomes apparent that they are composed of hundreds of distinct little components
			- Each of these components are sourced from various suppliers 
			- Each can be a potential vulnerability if they are tampered with
			- Or if sourced from untrustworthy vendors
		- Conduct rigorous supply chain assessments to trace the origins of our hardware, and to verify the integrity of the components in our enterprise networks
		- The origin of the components in our network infrastructure, can also define the trustworthiness of the entire device that we are looking at
		- Consider the DOD (Department of Defense)
			- Measures like the Trusted Foundry Programme
				- Ensure that all the hardware installed on their networks have undergone a strict check that they are authentic, and that the microprocessor in them have been manufactured securely to perform only their designated functions, without any deviations from their known good baseline
		- Purchase of additional hardware from secondary or aftermarket sources
			- Devices could have been tampered with, or could contain malware/trojans that could gain access to enterprise networks or cause operational failures
	- Software Developers/Providers
		- Often the risk to networks come from the software that has been installed on that network
		- Software devs are integral cogs in supply chains
		- Check if the software is properly licensed
		- Authentic, and free from any known vulnerabilities or bugs
		- Checked with anti-malware or anti-virus solution
			- To ensure it's free of any malicious code
		- Easier to conduct the checks if the source code is open-source, that way you can review the entire source-code if you need to
	- Managed Service Providers (MSPs)
		- Organisations that provide a range of technology services and support to businesses and other clients
		- Evaluate data security measures
		- Ensure confidentiality and integrity
		- Assess cyber security protocols
		- Can they have a solid response to a security breach
			- A full-scale incident response or a forensic investigation
	- A supply chain audit and inspection
	- Vendor selection is one of those important items that, and it's not just a matter of cost efficiency - have to consider, factor in due diligence, historical performance, and commitment to security when considering service provider
	- In the realm of supply chain risks by your organisations security posture - you are only as strong as your weakest link in that supply chain

- Supply Chain Attacks
	- Supply chain networks can become more vast and intertwined
	- Supply chain attack - attack that involves targeting a weaker link in the supply chain to gain access to a primary target
	- Instead of attacking a well fortified entity directly, attackers may focus their attack to vulnerabilities inside of their suppliers and service providers to pave their way into the companies and often larger and more complex systems
	- Chip washing
		- Repackaging the contents of a microchip with a less expensive one, or one with embedded with malware
		- Consider routers, switches, well branded devices such as with Cisco
	- Deliberate embedded of root kits within devices by your overseas suppliers
		- Can provide backdoor access to networks once the device is active
	- Conducting a good vendor assessment is important
	- Hardware, software, service providers
	- CHIPS Act
		- 2022
		- US federal statute that provides roughly $280 billion in new funding to boost research and manufacturing of semiconductors inside the United States
		- Chips and Science Act (aka)
	- Semiconductors
		- Essential components in a wide range of products, from smartphones and cars to medical devices and defense systems
	- Global semiconductor supply chain is really complex and interconnected, and disruptions to the supply chain can have significant economic and security implications
	- Safeguarding against supply chain attacks:
		- Vendor due diligence
		- Regular monitoring and audits
		- Education and collaboration
		- Incorporating contractual safeguards
	- Vendor Due Diligence
		- Organisations must practice rigorous due diligence when onboarding their vendors, especially those with access to critical systems or data
		- Involves understanding the vendor cybersecurity posture, but also their own supply chain management and security practices
	- Regular monitoring and audits
		- Continuous monitoring and periodic audits of your supply chain are considered essential
		- Helps have an early detection mechanism for any suspicious activities or vulnerabilities that may be exploited by an attacker
	- Education and collaboration
		- Keeping the broader ecosystem informed about the latest security threats, vulnerabilities and best practices, we can ensure that our industry - as a whole - remains better protected
		- Collaborating with other organisations and industry groups can really provide you with a more holistic view and a joint defense strategy against these kinds of supply chain attacks and threats
	- Incorporating contractual safeguards
		- Engaging with suppliers or service providers, using a contract and that contract shouldn't beg clauses related to cybersecurity within them. 
		- This type of contract language can help to ensure that vendors adhere to stipulated security standards and that there are legal repercussions if they don't meet your standards or requirements as outlined inside of that contract. 
	- The expanding web of global supply chains exposes organisations to an array of new challenges every single day. 
	- A single vulnerability in a seemingly insignificant component could have massive ripple effects
	- Causing worldwide disruptions on a massive scale
	- Securing supply chains isn't just about the information technology of the cybersecurity department anymore
	- It is really everyone's business inside of our organisation, because it is at the heart of our very survival and integrity of our organisations, and our nations. 

- Vendor Assessment
	- Process that organisations implement to evaluate the security, reliability, and performance of external entities
	- A weak link in one vendor can have reverberations across multiple businesses and lead to widespread vulnerabilities and potential data breaches. 
	- Primary entities:
		- Vendors
		- Suppliers
		- MSPs
	- Vendors:
		- Typically businesses or individuals, that provide goods or services to an organisation
		- Software providers like MS or Oracle
		- The organisation relies on these vendors for an enterprise solution
	- Suppliers:
		- Typically going to be involved in the production and delivery of products or parts of products.
		- A computer manufacturer might have multiple suppliers
			- One providing processors
			- Another memory
			- Another hard drives
			- And so on
		- MSPs (Managed Service Providers)
			- Hired by a company to manage IT services on behalf of the company
			- Like a Cloud Service Provider (AWS or Google Cloud) and they're going to be used to manage vast data infrastructures so your organisation can instead focus on their core competencies
	- One vital aspect of the Vendor Assessment Process is penetration testing of your suppliers. 
		- Essentially a simulated cyberattack against your supplier systems to check for exploitable vulnerabilities.
		- Imagine a company that sources its software from a third-party developer
			- Penetration testing the software would mean attempting to find and exploit vulnerabilities
			- Just like an actual cyber attacker would
			- In an order to attempt to attempt their own attacks against your network
		- If a vulnerability is found, this would be an indiciation that the software could be a risk to your organisation's cybersecurity posture. 
		- The goal with conducting a penetration test is really to validate that our service provider, or vendor, is taking their own cybersecurity posture seriously - since their risks become your risk once you install their software on your network
	- When conducting your vendor assessments, one part of that is to review your contract with the vendor or service provider
		- When reviewing the contract, you should verify that you have a right to audit clause included inside of that contract
		- This Right To Audit Clause is going to grant your organisation the right to evaluate the vendor's internal processes and ensure that they're in compliance with the agreed upon standards. 
	-  Inside of cybersecurity, we always to want to trust, but verify
	- Another element that instills confidence in vendor security is evidence of internal audits being conducted.
		- An internal audit refers to a vendor's self assessment, where they would evaluate their own practices against industry standards or organisational requirements.
		- ie
			- A cloud service provider might regularly audit its data protection measures to ensure that encryption protocols are up-to-date and effectively implemented
		- When a vendor can present evidence of consistent and comprehensive internal audits, this does serve as a testament to their commitment to security and quality
		- Internal audits may sometimes be insufficient, especially if one is lacking the rigor involved with them
	- Independent assessments are evaluations conducted by third-party entities who have no stake in the organisation or vendor's operations
		- A neutral party who's going to be coming in to make sure the vendor is adhering to the security and/or performance standards that you have both agreed to. 
		- Consider
			- A data centre that houses critical information for multiple organisations. 
			- A third-party, independent organisation, like the ISO (International Standards Organisation) might assess the data centre's practices against its global standards to ensure they're meeting or surpassing the benchmarks. 
		- This third-party validation is going to be invaluable for organisations who aim to minimise their exposure to risk
	- Supply Chain Analysis
		- Used to dive deep into a vendor's entire supply chain and assess the security and reliability of each link
		- Acknowledging that the vendor's security is not just about their practices, but also encompasses their entire supply chain's integrity. 
	- The security and reliability of our vendors will directly impact our organisation's own wellbeing and security
	- While trusting our partners is important, actively ensuring their adherence to top-notch standards is also equally as important as we need to ensure that we conduct
		- a vendor assessment
		- a contract review
		- a penetration test
		- and other internal or external audits to validate that our suppliers and vendors are remaining in compliance with the security requirements that are contained with the service contracts
