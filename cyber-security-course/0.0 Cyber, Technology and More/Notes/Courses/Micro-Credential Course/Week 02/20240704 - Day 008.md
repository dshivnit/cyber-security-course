- Web Browsing Security
	- Developer Tools in various browsers
	- Every website runs HTML (the natural language of the web)
	- Layout of websites are similar to a filesystem layout
	- Script commands
		- Tell the system to look up another website
		- or look up in a directory the contents in a file
		- nonce command
			- number used once (in Cryptography)
	- Meta tags
		- Certain values that the website may have
		- Crawlers scan the web probing for various meta tags that would be relevant to a search query
		- SEOs Search Engine Optimisation
	- Inspecting sites/elements
		- Console > check it out
	- - React libraries
		- React dev tools
			- Removes div tags
			- seperate section created which has a list of all the components it uses
			- Refer to DOMs below
	- DOM - Document Object Model
		- Insert their own custom tags down inside the document
			- Called components
			- You can construct other components and put them inside that component for example
	- Ways to speed up the access/performance of a page
		- Where the script tag is placed on the page
			- Wherever you put the script in the code will be when it gets processed. 
	- CSS Zen Garden
		- Been out for 20 years or so now roughly
		- https://www.csszengarden.com/
	- SCSS
	- LESS
	- SASS
		- These above take a higher-level language and convert it to CSS (makes styling easier)
	- Don't forget
		- Front end 
		- Back end
		- parts of a websystem
	- HTTP Status Codes
		- HTTP - protocol how a request should be viewed by a web browser (client) and how a server responds to that request (by the web server)
		- 5 main types of status codes
		- The ones that are prefixed with the number 1 have a certain meaning
		- same with 2, 3 4, and 5
		- the 2's
			- Mean that nothing went wrong when the request was made
			- 200 and 201 are most common
				- 200 websserver has responded successfully with your request
				- 201 created - when you ask the web server to create some data, it would have done that
				- Can't really rely on these sometimes as they get mixed up
				- The person who chooses these are the developer(s)
			- 300s
				- Redirects
				- If you go to a webpage and the page has been moved
				- Temp redirect
				- Permanent redirect
				- 301 
					- Moved permanents
						- Tells the web browser don't go to this address again, go to *this one* (sends the client, web browser, the proper URL/address to go to)
						- This lives in cache 
				- 302 
				- 400s and 500s
				- Server based ones
					- 400
						- 404 not found
						- 405 Method Not Allowed
							- HTTP has verbs to tell the web server what to do 
								- GET
									- Giving to the client
									- Updating the address the bar
										- Some bad designs will have sensitive information in the address bar (the URL can sometimes be copied and given to others by end-users say for example)
										- Tracking identifiers as well
								- POST
									- I want to give you some brand new data (telling the web server)
								- DELETE
									- Some people sometimes do a post to a particular resource and then run a 
								- PUT
									- Put your underwear on before you put your pants on (don't be like Superman.. In this regard lel)
								- Some developers don't know these verbs well sometimes
								- You can perform a GET on a website which issues a DELETE command/verb (newbie mistake)
									- GET a wordlist or something like that, which when clicked, will actually DELETE another resource somewhere 
										- something along the lines of this
										- Crawlers (BOTs) can sometimes click on these functions, because it's a clicker/code that's doing its own thing
						- 413 Payload Too Large
							- Chunking - streaming sites do this a fair bit
							- You click on a video or an audio file, it sends you a chunk
						- 410 Gone
							- whytheluckystiff or _ why (person)
								- Made some cull RubyOnRails stuff
								- Someone doxxed him, disappeared
							- Mark Pilgrim
								- Had a resource called Dive into Python
								- Someone did something, so he redirected all of his content to a page that said 410 GONE.
									- But fortunately, he was still alive. Just had enough of the bs on the Internet
									- he's back, but not really contributing much to the community any more
						- 414 Request 
						- Have a look at http:cat for more
						- 420 Enhance Your Calm
						- 418 I'm a Teapot
					- 500 (JUICY ONES) - Internal Server Error
						- These normally describe a fair bit of information around the site
						- Some error occurred on the server with the code
						- 503 - Service Unavailable
						- 504 - Gateway Timeout
						- 509 - Bandwidth Limit  Exceeded
						- 
- URL (the website part of a web address)
- URI (everything after it)
- API Key
	- You need a login token to be able to access data

- Programming
	- Syntax
- HTML
	- All tags are kept within surrounded by less than and a greater than sign (lol)
	- Structure
		- HTML tags at top
		- Head
			- Title
			- 
		- Body
	- src = links to another URL resource
	- script nonce =
	- favicon
	- stylesheet
	- rel
		- stylesheet
			- CSS
				- Defines different styles that would be used - pretty much a parent template
	- Meta tags
		- SEO's (Search Engine Optimisation) 
		- Categorise queries/results given based upon various tags that systems use
	- 
	- search
	- manifest
	- type
	- minification
		- trying to minimise as much as you can to decrease web traffic/load on the web server(s) serving
	- div
	- Semantic codes being used now as opposed to divs
		- Divs are still used, however, not as much as in the past
		- More accessible
		- Assisting people who are visually impaired
	- 
	-  # - anchor symbol
		- So you can have your front-end jump around in different sections of the webpage
		- People figured out that if they could combine these anchor symbols
		- Single Page Applications (SPA)
			- Applications that use the # symbol, when you click on it, will jump to the section in the page, but hides elements/functions that are normally there (no hashtag)
			- Angular were the first to do this (cleaner URLs)
				- React, View, some other front end libraries 
			- SPA trade off when you first visit a website, it will send down the entire application to the client
				- Depending on how it is coded
				- And depending on how the client is authenticated
				- Also starting 
			- PWA - Progressing Web Application
