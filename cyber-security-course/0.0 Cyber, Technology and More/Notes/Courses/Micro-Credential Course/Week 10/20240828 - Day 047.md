ToDo:
- Work on Cryptography - become a CryptoNurd
	- ffs
- Get GPG4win working with Thunderbird > or test the functionality of it
	- Also with Outlook
- Run through using GPG, Kleopatra, and get used to working with it
- Bullrun decryption system
- https://tuckercarlson.com/the-tucker-carlson-interview-pavel-durov
- Look into the "legalness/legality" history of cryptography
- KN95 masks 
- GPG4win and muck around with encrypting files between different users and do some testing
- HxD Tool 
	- Pin it, reference it, document it
- Look into Bots posting comments in social media platforms
	- Look into relation to C&C2 servers
	- See how this is linked up
- South Africa and Nigeria wars
	- Look into the population base and age group demographics in Nigeria
		- 30s
		- under 30s
		- etc 
		- Globally!
