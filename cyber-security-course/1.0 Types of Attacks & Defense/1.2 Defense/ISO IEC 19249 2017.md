ISO/IEC 19249:2017
Information Technology - Security Techniques - Catalogue of Architectural and Design Principles for Secure Products, Systems and Applications
- The purpose is to have a better idea of what international organisations would teach regarding security principles. 

Five Architectural Principles:
- Domain Separation
	- Every set of related components is grouped as a **single entity**
	- Components can be applications, data, or other resources
	- Each entity will have its own domain and be assigned a common set of security attributes
		- Example:
			- the x86 processor privilege levels
			- The OS kernel can run in RING 0 (the most privileged level)
			- User applications can run in RING 3 (the least privileged level)
			- Domain separation is included in the Goguen-Meseguer Model
- Layering
	- When a system is built with many abstract levels/layers - imposing security policies at different levels becomes possible!
	- Also, it is feasible to validate the operations between each layer
	- Consider the OSI model and its layers
		- Each layer provides specific services to the layer above it
		- This makes it possible to impose security policies and easily validate that the system is working as it should be, as it is intended
	- Another example from THM - programming and disk operations:
		- A programmer usually uses the disk read and write functions provided by the high-level programming language that is being used
		- The programming language hides the low-level system calls and presents them in a more user-friendly manner to the programmer. 
	- Layering relates to Defense in Depth
- Encapsulation
	- In OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) - low-level implementations are hidden, and the direct manipulation of data in an object is prevented by providing specific methods for that purpose. 
		- Ie, you can only change the data in object by making a method-call to said object, that method will do what is allowed to be done to the object (there is no going lower-level and tweaking things when they shouldn't be tweaked)
		- Another consideration would be in larger systems with the use of API's that your application can use to access whatever database it is trying to access
- Redundancy
	- Ensures availability and integrity
	- Examples from THM
		- Consider a server with two built-in power supplies
			- If one fails, there is a fail-safe
		- Or a RAID 5 configuration with three drives
			- If one fails, data is still available with the remaining two drives
			- If data is changed on one of the disks, it would be detected via parity, ensuring integrity
- Virtualisation
	- Sharing a single set of hardware among multiple OSs
	- Provides sandboxing capabilities that improve security boundaries, secure detonation, and observance of malicious programs

**Five** Design Principles:
- Least Privilege
	- "Need-to-basis" or "Need-to-know-basis"
	- "who can access what"
	- You should provide the least amount of permissions for someone to carry out their task and nothing more
	- ie - If a user wants to view a document, you give then READ ONLY permissions, not READ/WRITE.
- Attack Surface Minimisation
	- Every system has vulnerabilities that an attacker might use to compromise a system
	- Some vulnerabilities are known, while others are yet to be discovered
	- These vulns represent risks that we should aim to minimise
	- ie - In the steps to hardening a Linux system - we should disable any service we don't need.
- Centralised Parameter Validation
	- Many threats are due to the system receiving input, especially from end-users!
	- Invalid inputs can be used to exploit vulns in the system, such as a DOS, and Remote Code Execution, SQL Injections and so on
	- Parameter Validation is a fundamental step to ensure the correct system state
	- Considering the number of parameters a system handles, the validation of the parameters should be centralised within one library or system.
- Centralised General Security Services
	- We should aim to centralise all security services, as a principle
	- ie - we would create a centralised server for authentication
		- Proper measures must be set in place to ensure availability and prevent creating a single point of failure..
- Preparing for Error and Exception Handling
	- We should take into account that errors and exceptions do and will occur when we are building a system
	- ie 
		- a firewall crashes - it should block all traffic instead of allowing all traffic.
		- Be careful that error messages don't leak information that we consider confidential, such as dumping memory content that contains information related to other users/customers
