Risk Assessments:

Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities on a Client's system and/or network.

- Developing a Risk Matrix
- Identifying Risk Ratings
- Improving the Client's security posture
- These assessments assist the Client in prioritising and implementing appropriate security measures to mitigate and minimise cyber security risks
- Assists in assuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Client's information systems.

- Definitions:
	- Risk Assessment
		- Process of identifying potential, analysing their likelihood and potential impact, and implementing measures to mitigate those risks
	- Risk Position
		- The level of risk that an organisation faces
	- Risk Matrix:
		- A tool used to assess and evaluate risks based on the likelihood and consequence of a risk event occurring
	- Likelihood
		- The probability of a risk event occurring
	- Consequence:
		- The severity of the potential impact of a risk event
	- Risk Rating:
		- A measure of the overall risk posed by a scenario, calculated by multiplying the likelihood and consquence
	- Inherent risk rating:
		- The risk rating of a scenario without any measures in place to reduce the risk
	- Current risk rating:
		- The risk rating of a scenario with existing measures in place to reduce the risk
	- Target risk rating:
		- The desired risk rating of a scenario with additional measures put in place to further reduce the risk
	- Risk Assessment Report:
		- A report that summarises the risk assessment findings, the risk mitigation strategy, and any recommended measures for implementation
	- Avoid risk:
		- Completely eliminate or forgo risk
	- Treat risk:
		- Reduce the likelihood or impact of risk
	- Transfer risk:
		- Assign or move the risk to a third party
	- Accept risk:
		- Acknowledge the risk and choose not to resolve, transfer or mitigate

0. Define the Client's Risk Position
1. Define the context
	- Identify assets that need to be protected
		- Sensitive information
		- Customer data
		- Financial information
		- Critical assets important to the client
2. Define the Risk Matrix
	- Define the likelihood, consequence and risk rating for each potential risk scenario
		- Risk Rating - multiplying the likelihood and consequence of a risk
3. Define Risk Scenarios
	- Identify the specific risks that the Client is trying to protect their assets from
	- Examples:
		- A cyberattack
		- A natural disaster
		- Employee negligence
4. Assess risk rating for each scenario
	- Calculate the inherent risk rating for each risk scenario
	- Assuming initially that there are *no* measures set in place to reduce the risk
5. Assess risk rating for each scenario with the *current* measures that are set in place
6. Assess risk levels for each scenario with *additional* measures set in place and define their ratings
7. Create a Risk Assessment Report for the client which will summarise the findings above, the risk mitigation strategy, and any recommended measures that can be set in place for implementation
