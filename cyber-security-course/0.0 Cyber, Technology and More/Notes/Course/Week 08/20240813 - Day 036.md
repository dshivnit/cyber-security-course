Networking / Subnetting

- Private Network Ranges
- Class A
	- 0. - 126.
- Localhost
	- 127.
- Class B
	- 128. - 191. 
- Class C
	- 128. - 223.
- The above have already been referenced in [[Networking]]
- Also check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network
- Cloud based services will sometimes have additional nodes reserved - so the common rule of thumb to take away two addresses from a subnet (for the network IP and the Broadcast IP) may need to be adjusted, depending on what the Cloud Service Providers system outlines
- Tools can be used, but it's good to know how to break down a network/subnet further - good skill
- Example tool:

Firewalls
- Block rules can affect system performance if in numbers
	- Keep that in mind and with the rules that you have in place
	- As the Firewall will then have to process much more before allowing packets through
		- Which can affect service to sensitive or time-critical components within
- Will normally have a secondary interface for in the event that the main interface goes down or is suffering from a DDOS attack
- DDOS Attacks can get up to 500GBps (and possibly more) incoming, which can't be defended against
	- So backups routes would need to be set in place

PIP 
Python
Sockets
	- This will add the $HOME/.local/bin to $PATH
	- 
	`export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
~./.zshrc 
- Gets loaded everytime you login to terminal/shell
- (using zsh shell, same but different file name for bash and others etc)

Python
	ptpython
	bpython

Virtual Environment - A Folder!
- python3.11-venv
- python3 -m venv myvenv
- ls myvenv
- env
- source myvenv /bin/activate

- bpython
	- Getting a listening port on localhost
	- import socket
	- socket. (have a look at the commands)

- Python Web-server 
	- UWSGI

- netstat -ah (or whatever the parameter is to show open/listening ports)
- 
source myvenv
