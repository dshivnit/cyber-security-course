- Javascript is primarily used for client-side programming
- Node.js allows developers to build server-side applications using Javascript

- Threading
	- `import threading`
	- Look it up and do stuff :) 
	- Race Conditioning
		- https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/how-we-found-and-fixed-a-rare-race-condition-in-our-session-handling/
	- Deadlock
	- Semaphores
		- Typically used to coordinate access to resources
	- Locking
		- Synchronisation mechanisms used to control access to shared resources among multiple threads
		- Ensure that only one thread can access a critical section of code or data at a time, preventing race conditions and maintaining data integrity
	- Resource starvation

	- 
	- Race Conditions
	- Threading
	- Lib folder contains base Python libraries 
		- `python -m http.server`
		- lib > server
	- PICKLE library
		- https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/
		- `import pickle`
		- `name = "whatever"`
		- `pickle.dumps(name)`
			- will create a hex dump of of the variable `name`
			- Serialisation
		- 
		- `pickle.loads(hexdump)
			- Deserialisation
		- A binary serialization format
- Saving space across the network, every byte counts
- Curly braces and quotes are common in JSON
	- Encodings to reduce data stored when sending serialized data across a network
	- Serialization
		- Pickle
		- Protobuf
			- https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/pythontutorial/ (for Python)
		- MessagePack
		- 
	- JSON
		- Javascript Object Notation
		- Plaintext over the wire
	- JSON Web Tokens
		- https://jwt.io/
		- Encoded in base64
		- Information stored locally
			- Don't Trust a User
		- 
- Deserializing is NOT SAFE
	- Commands can be run
	- The contents of whatever is being deserialized can be unsafe/malicious
- Packing
	- Compressing code that is running inside of your system
	- Packers
	- Similar to minifying code in Javascript
	- To prevent people from looking at your code and debugging it
	- Can make the code to change parts of memory - where it inserts bits into random parts of random memory addresses
		- then go off an execute from that random memory address
	- **Self-modifying code** is a malware technique, AND ALSO an anti-piracy technique
