Aims to achieve Integrity by specifying:
- Simple Integrity Property
	- Referred to as "no read down"
	- A higher integrity subject should not read from a lower integrity object
- Star Integrity Property
	- Referred to as "no write up"
	- A lower integrity subject should not write to a higher integrity object

Doesn't handle insider (internal) threats.
