- Application-Level (Layer 7) protocol that relies on UDP 
- Server listens on UDP port 67
- Client sends from UDP port 68
- DORA
	- Discover
		- Client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message seeking a DHCP server if one exists
	- Offer
		- Server responds with a DHCPOFFER message with an IP Address available for the client to accept
	- Request
		- Client responds with a DHCPREQUEST message advising that it will accept the offered IP
	- Acknowledge
		- Server responds with a DHCPACK message confirming that the IP address offered has now been assigned to the respective client.
- The initial Discover and Request messages are sent via the 0.0.0.0 IP address, broadcasting to the Network (on 255.255.255.255) - this being the client broadcasting as it doesn't have a local IP assigned to it yet. And is reliant upon its MAC address. 
- Remember, MAC stands for Media Access Control
