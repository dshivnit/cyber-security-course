- To ensure that clients don't receive illegitimate responses from rogue 'dns' servers, as clients will accept any response given
- DNSSEC requires two things:
	- The DNS Zone Owner should sign all DNS records using their private key
		- Showing the authenticity of the response given by the said DNS server
	- The DNZ zone publishes its public key so that users can check the validity of the DNS record signatures
		- Again, to double-check and ensure the authenticity of the given certs and responses
- The data in the DNS query is signed to ensure integrity, and authenticity are kept intact
