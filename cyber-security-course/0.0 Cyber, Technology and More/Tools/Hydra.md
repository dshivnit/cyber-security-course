- A quick system login password hacking/cracking tool
- Can brute force some auth services
- Similar to John

- Options that are passed into hydra will depend on which protocol we're focusing on
- `hydra -l user -P passwordlist.txt ftp://123.123.123.123`
	- Brute forcing an FTP login with the given username (`-l`) or login name
	- Using a passwordlist `passwordlist.txt`
	- and the FTP server
- `-t`
	- Set the number of threads to run
- `hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist-file> <host-ip> <request-type> "<path>:<form-parametres>:<condition string>"
- Example:
	- `hydra -l bob -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 123.123.123.123 http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Your username or password is incorrect." -V`
		- Here are making a POST request via a login form at `http://123.123.123.123/login`
		- The form fields for:
			- Username field in the form is named `username`
			- Password field in the form is named `password`
			- The `^USER^` and `^PASS^` variables outline the username and password that hydra will use in it's processing
			- The `F=Your username or password is incorrect.` bit outlines the error message that the web-system gives upon a unsuccessful login attempt
			- The `-V` here enables each login+pass to be described in every attempt
