1.1 Security Controls
- Security measures for countering and minimising loss or unavailability of services or apps due to vulnerabilities 
- Safeguards and countermeasures
		- Safeguards are proactive
		- Countermeasures are reactive (reduce impact after occurrence)
- Categories
- These categories will overlap into multiple Security Control Types
	- Technical
		- The implementation of the hardware and software, the technology
		- Hardware or software mechanisms used to manage access to resources and systems and provide protection for those resources and systems
			- Encryption
			- Smart cards
			- Passwords
			- Biometrics
			- ACLs
			- Firewalls, routers
			- IDS/IPS
		- The technology used
	- Managerial
		- Policies and procedures
		- The processes documented
		- Administrative controls defined by an organisations security policy
		- Uses planning and assessment methods to review the organisations ability to reduce and manage risk
			- Policies
			- Procedures
			- Hiring processes
			- Background checks
			- Data classification 
			- Security training
			- Risk assessments
			- Vulnerability assessments
		- All these practices laid out in policies and procedures that the organisation will outline
	- Operational
		- People doing stuff
		- Helps to ensure that the day-to-day operations of an organisation comply with their overall security. 
		- Primarily implemented and executed by people instead of systems
		- People, enforcing the managerial controls supporting physical security and using the technology we've implemented through technical control to ensure we comply with our overall security strategy 
			- Awareness training
			- Configuration management
			- Media protection
		- The doing.
	- Physical
		- Tangible, touchable
		- Security mechanisms focused on providing protection to the facility and real-world objects.
			- Guards
			- Fences
			- Lights
			- Motion detectors
			- Guard dogs
			- Video cameras
			- Alarms
			- Laptop locks
		- Protecting what we can touch

- Control Types (know two examples of each)
- For example, a security camera is both a deterrent and a detective type
- CONTEXT matters
- There will be overlaps here
	- Preventive
		- To thwart or stop unwanted or unauth'd activity from occuring
		- Fences, locks, physical things, job rotation, data classification, penetrating testing, access control methods
	- Deterrent
		- Deployed to discourage violation of security policies
		- Same as above, more physical, security awareness training, security policies, separation of duties
	- Detective
		- Deployed to discover or detect unwanted activity
		- Security guards, dogs, motion detectors, job rotation, mandatory vacations, audit trails, IDS's, violation reports, honey pots, incident investigations
	- Corrective
		- Modifies the environment to return systems to normal after an unwanted or unauthorised activity has occurred
		- Backups and restores, patching, antivirus/antimalware, forensic analysis, disciplinary action
	- Compensating
		- Provides options to other existing controls to aid in enforcement of security policies
		- Security policy, personnel supervision, monitoring and work task procedures
	- Directive
		- Direct, confine, or control the actions of subjects to force or encourage compliance with security policies 
		- Policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, contracts/agreements

1.2 Summarise Fundamental Security Concepts

- CIA triad
	- Confidentiality
		- Access controls help ensure that only authorised subjects can access objects
	- Integrity
		- Ensures that data or system configurations are not modified without proper authorisation 
		- That the file sent, matches exactly the file received
		- That the system files on an operating system are not modified without authorissation
			- This kind of thing
	- Availability
		- Authorised requests for objects must be granted to subjects within a reasonable amount of time
	
- Non-repudiation
	- The ability to defeat/counter a false rejection or refusal of an obligation with irrefutable evidence
	- Guarantees that no one can deny a transaction
	- Methods:
		- Digital Signatures
			- Prove that a digital message or document was not modified - intentionally or unintentionally - from the time it was signed. 
			- Based on asymmetric cryptography
			- The digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal
			- Provides non-repudiation in a publicly verifiable manner
	- REMEMBER:
		- Shared accounts/identities prevent non-repudiation
	
- AAA
	- Several protocols provide authentication, authorisation, and accounting services
	- Authentication
		- User/service proves identity with some type of credentials
	- Authorisation
		- Authenticated users are granted access to resources based on the permissions granted to them
	- Accounting
		- Methods that track user activity and record these activity in logs
		- As part of the audit trail (user activity and resource access)
		- Authenticating people
		- Authenticating systems
		- Authorisation models
	- Identification and Authentication
		- Identification
			- Claims an identity, and identification can be as simple as a username for a User, an AD account
		- Authentication
			- Subjects prove their identity by providing authentication credentials such as the matching password for a Username
		- Authorisation
			- Systems can authorise access to objects based on their proven identity
			- Non-discretionary Access Control
				- Enables the enforcement of system-wide restrictions that override object-specific access control
				- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an example
			- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
				- Use-based and User-centric
				- A key characteristic of the DAC is that every object has an owner, and the owner can grant or deny access to any other object in its DAC
			- RBAC - Role Based Access Control
				- Use of roles or groups. Instead of assigning permissions directly to Users, User Accounts are placed in roles and administrators assign privileges to the roles
					- Typically mapped to job roles
			- Rule-Based Access Control
				- Applies to global rules that apply to all subjects. Rules within this model are sometimes referred to as restrictions or filters
				- ie
					- A firewall, that applies rules to all Users equally
			- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
				- Every object and every subject has one or more labels. 
				- These labels are predefined and the system determines access based on assigned labels
			- Attribute-Based Access Control
				- Based on attribute(s) on the account, such as the department, location or functional desgination
		- Accountability
			- Auditing logs and audit trails record events including the identity of the subject that performed an action 
			- Maintained for individual subjects using auditing
			- Logs record user activities and users can be held accountable for their logged actions
			- Directly promotes good User behaviour and compliance with the organisations security policy
			- Provides an audit trail for investigation if needed
			- Machines have identities too
	- Subjects
		- A user, group or service accessing resources, known as objects
	- Objects, 
		- Resources, such as files, folders shares and printers, accessed by subjects
	
- Gap Analysis
	- Common task performed on a recurring basis, and often in preparation for external audits
		- A gap analysis
	- Auditors will follow a standard (often ISO 27001) and then compare standard requirements to the organisation's current operations
	- Deficiencies versus the standard will be captured in the audit report as gaps, sometimes called control gaps
	- Control Gap
		- A discrepancy between the security measures an organisation should have in place versus controls actually in place
	- Attestation
		- The outcome of an audit
		- A formal statement made by the auditor on controls and processes in place
	- Both internal and external auditors should have independence in the process. External carry more weight as they aren't directly employed by the organisation

- Zero Trust
	- An approach to security architecture in which no entity is trusted by default
	- Based on three principles:
		- Assume breach
		- Verify explicitly
		- Least privilege access
	- Supports Defense in depth, that advises a layered approach to security
	- Treats identity as the control plane
	- Control plane (this drives the policy-based decision logic for zero trust)
		- Adaptive identity
			- Changes the way that the system asks a user to authenticate based on context of the request
				- Elements like location, device health, app, any risk associated with the user? 
		- Threat scope reduction
			- An end goal of ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Architecture)
			- Which is to decrease risks to the organisation
		- Policy-driven access control
			- Controls based on a users identity rather than their systems location
			- ie Conditional access in MS's Entra ID
		- Policy administrator
			- Responsible for communicating the decisions made by the policy engine
			- Element of the system, not a human person
		- Policy engine
			- Decides whether to grant access to a resource to a given subject
				- ie Entra ID
		- Policy Administrator + Policy Engine = make up the Policy Decision Point
	- Data plane (Enforces the decisions defined in the control plane) 
		- Implicit trust zones
			- Part of traditional security approaches like firewalls, and other devices formed in a perimeter
		- Subject/System
			- Subject is a user who is wanting to access a resource
			- System is a non-human entity, often a device used by the user to access the resource also on a system
		- Policy Enforcement Point
			- When a user or system requests access to a resource, the policy enforcement point evaluates it against predefined policies and applies the necessary controls 
	- Verify Identity
	- Manage Devices
	- Manage Apps
	- Protect Data
	- Access Policy Enforcement
		- Policy Enforcement Point
			- Responsible for enabling, monitoring and terminating connections between a subject (such as a user or device) and an enterprise resource
			- Acts as the gateway that enforces access control policies
		- The PEP evaluates requests against predefined policies and applies the necessary controls
		- For example:
			- PEP might enforce MFA for access requests from unexpected locations
				- Dynamic based on conditions/context
		- Policy Decision Point
			- Where access decisions are made based on various factors such as user identity, device health, and risk assessment 
			- Evaluates the context of an access request and decides whether it should be allowed, denied or subjected to additional controls
			- Considers the 5 W's (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY)
		- The PEP enforces policies at the connection level
		- The PDP makes access decisions based on contextual information
	
- Physical Security
	- There is no security without physical security
	- Without control over the physical environment, no amount of admin or technological/logical access controls can provide adequate security
	- That first outer later of protection
	- If a malicious person can gain physical access to your facility or equipment, they can do just about anything they want, from destruction to disclosure and alteration.

		- Think about location, efficiency and protection
		- Entrances
		- Automation, light dimmers and motion sensors can save on electricity costs
		- Protect the lights. If the lights can be taken down somehow, taking the lightbulb, or turning off a switch - then there goes this preventative mech. 
	- Sensors
		- Infrared

			- Integrated into cameras and alarm systems to improve detection capabilities
		- Pressure
			- Detects changes in pressure on a surface or in a specific area
		- Microwave
			- Used to detect movement in a specific area

- Deception and Disruption Technology
	- The Honey Pot
		- Lure bad to doing bad things. Just for observation
		- Not to entice or entrap!
			- Don't let these bad's break the law
		- Used to distract from real assets and isolate in a padded cell until they can be tracked down
	- Honey Net
		- A group of honey pots
	- Honeyfile
		- A decoy file
		- Deceptively named so it becomes attractive
	- Honeytoken
		- A fake record inserted into a database to detect data theft
