- Data Classifications
	- Category based on the organisations value and the sensitivity of the information if it were to be disclosed
	- Level of classification is decided by the Data Owner
	- Sensitive
		- Any information that can result in a loss of security or a loss of advantage to a company if accessed by an unauthorised person
		- Anything sensitive we want protection around
		- Higher classification will need more protection and more resources spent against them
		- Overclassifying data leads to protecting all data at a high level
		- Two different classification schemes used by organisation, mainly:
			- Commercial Business
				- One of four levels:
					- Public
						- No impact on the company if released
						- Usually information that is posted on the open-source environment, like the company website or other platforms
					- Sensitive
						- Has minimal impact if released (organisations financial data)
					- Private
						- Contains data that should only be used within the organisation
						- Salary information
						- Employee information
						- Private data is information that relates to an individual entity
					- Confidential
						- Contain items such as trade secrets, intellectual property data, source code that affect the business if disclosed
						- Can only be approved by approved personnel, or third parties under an NDA
					- Critical
						- Contains valuable information
						- Entrusted to a few individuals
						- Example - credit card information
			- Governmental
				- Unclassified
					- Data that can be released to the public or under the Freedom of Information Act (USA..)
				- Sensitive but Unclassified
					- Data that would not hurt national security if released but could impact those whose data was being used 
				- Confidential
					- Data that could seriously affect the government if unauthorised disclosures happen
				- Secret
					- Data that could seriously damage national security if disclosed
				- Top Secret
					- Data that would damage national security if disclosed
					- ie blueprints for a new weapon..
	- Lifecycle of the Data as you:
		- Collect it
		- Retain it
		- Dispose of it
	- Data should not be stored forever
		- There should be policies that dictate:
			- How data is being stored
			- When it will be stored
			- How long will it be stored
	- The life cycle of data should be defined in policies
	- Follow the local, state, and government laws, and regulations for data retention time requirements 

- Data Ownership
	- Process of identifying the person responsible for the confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy of the information assets
	- Data Owners
		- Senior executive role that has the responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information asset
		- Labelling the asset, ensuring that it is protected with the appropriate controls
	- Data Controllers
		- The entity that holds responsibility for deciding the purposes and methods of data storage, collection, and usage, and for guaranteeing the legality of processes
	- Data Processors
		- Group or individual hired by the data controller to help with tasks like collecting, storing, or analysing data
	- Data Stewards
		- Focused on the quality of the data and the associated metadata
		- Working for the Data Owner
		- Involved in making sure that thee data is appropriately labelled and classified
	- Data Custodians
		- Responsible for handling the management of the system on which the data assets are stored
		- ie a System Administrator
		- Responsible for enforcing the access-control, encryption, the backup, recovery measures of said data
			- Requirements set forth by the Data Owner
	- Data Privacy Officer
		- Responsible for the oversight of any privacy related data
		- Like PII, SPI, PHI
	- Who should own the data?
		- Usually the CIO or the IT department
		- BUT
			- IT should more be the Data Custodian
		- Data Owners should be someone from the business-side
		- People who are creating this information
		- Data Owners should be someone inside each department, specialising in with what the data is for, does, represents
	- IT should not be the data owners, but rather those who know more about the data based on the content of the company
	- Someone who knows what the data is about
	- (IT Generally won't..)

- Data States
	- Data at rest
		- Refers to any data stored in DBs, file systems or other storage systems
		- Not actively moving through the network or processes
		- Data at rest is a prime target for threat actors
		- Encryption could be utilised
			- Full disk encryption
				- Encrypts the entire hard drive
				- when the system is off, the data is encrypted
				- When it's turned on, decrypted (after unlocking it)
			- Partition encryption
				- Encrypts specific partitions of a hard drive, leaving other partitions unencrypted
			- File encryption
				- Encrypts individual files
			- Volume encryption
				- Encrypts a set of selected files or directories
			- Database encryption 
				- Encrypts data stored in a database
			- Record encryption
				- Encrypts specific fields within a database record
	- Data in transit
		- Refers to data actively moving, from one location to another, such as across the Internet or through a private network
		- Vulnerable to interception through this journey
		- Some solutions to encrypt:
			- SSL/TLS
				- Cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network
			- VPNs
				- Creates a secure connection over a less secure network (like the Internet)
			- IPSec 
				- Protocol suite used to secure IP Communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in a data stream
	- Data in use
		- Refers to data in the process of being created, retrieved, updated, or deleted
		- Just as vulnerable as the other states
		- Challenging as the data needs to be decrypted in order to be used
		- Can be protected with encryption at the Application Level
		- Application Level
		- Access Controls
		- Secure Enclaves
		- Intel Software Guard

- Data Types
	- Regulated
		- PII PHI
		- Information controlled by laws, regulation or industry standards
		- Organisations that handle regulated data much comply with legislations that outline how the data should be handled
		- PII
			- Any information that can be used to identify an individual
				- Names
				- Addresses
				- etc
		- PHI 
			- Protected Health Information
	- Trade secrets
		-   Type of confidential business information that provides a company with a competitive edge
	- Intellectual property
		- Creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs and symbols
		- Unauthorised use of intellectual property can lead to legal action
	- Legal information
		- Includes any data related to legal proceedings, contracts or regulatory compliance
	- Financial information
		- Includes data related to an organisations financial transactions - sales records, invoices, tax documents, and bank statements
		- PCI DSS
			- Regulation
	- Human Readable and non human-readable data
		- Binary
		- Machine-code language

- Data Sovereignty
	- A concept where information is subject to the laws and governance structures within the nation where it is collected
	- A company must manage, store and process the data it holds in compliance with the laws of the country it is in
	- Must consider where the data is being held as well - through various parts of the world (with Cloud Computing for example)
	- Geographical Considerations
		- Location of storage and processing can significantly impact businesses
		- ie GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
			- Has stringent rules for data protection and grants individuals strong rights over their personal data
			- If you're dealing with data of EU citizens, regardless of its location - must comply with this regulation
		- ie China and Russia
			- Have strict data sovereignty laws that require companies to store and process data within their national borders
	- Knowing the physical location of data centres
	- Ensure that information is not illegally transferred
		- Without consent

- Securing Data
	- Geographic Restrictions (Geofencing)
		- Involves setting up virtual boundaries to restrict data access based on geographic location
	- Encryption
		- Fundamental data security method that transforms readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) using an algorithm and an encryption key
		- Crucial for protecting data at rest and data in transit
	- Hashing
		- Technique that converts data into a fixed size of numerical or alphanumeric characters, known as a hash value
		- Often used to store sensitive data, like passwords
		- Also used to check the integrity of files
	- Masking
		- Involves replacing some or all of the data in a field with a placeholder, such as "x", to conceal the original content
		- Once masked - it's one way process, it can't be reversed
		- Making it a method of de-identification
	- Tokenisation
		- Replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes known as token
		- The original data is stored securely in a different database
		- Used in payment processing systems to protect card information for example
	- Obfuscation 
		- Making data unclear, or unintelligible
		- Making it different for users to understand
		- Encryption, data masking and the use of pseudonyms
	- Segmentation
		- Involves dividing the network into separate segments, each with its own security controls
	- Permission Restriction
		- Involve defining who has access to specific data and what they can do with it
		- ACLs
		- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
	- Securing data can be a tedious but rewarding process

- Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
	- Set up to monitor the data of a system while it's in use, in transit, or at rest in order to detect any attempts to steal the data
	- Strategy for ensuring sensitive or critical information does not leave an organisation
	- Either intentionally or unintentionally
	- Consider working remotely - data sitting in the laptop
		- What happens when the laptop gets stolen
	- Also with external HDDs, thumbdrives, services like Google Drive
	- Huge problem for businesses
		- Data, Intellectual Property - is what the currency of businesses can be these days
	- DLPs
		- Software
		- Hardware
		- Endpoint DLP
			- A piece of software that's installed on a workstation or a laptop, and it's going to monitor the data that's in use on that computer
			- Can be set to 
				- Detection mode
				- Prevention mode
		- Network DLP system
			- A piece of software or hardware that's a solution placed at the perimeter of the network to detect data in transit
		- Storage DLP
			- Software that is installed on a server in the data centre and inspects the data while it's at rest on the server
			- Usually because it's been encrypted or watermarked 
			- Want to make sure that no one is accessing the data at times when they shouldn't be
				- ie at a strange time in the day
		- Cloud-based DLP
			- Usually offered as software-as-a-service, and it's part of the cloud service and storage needs
	- Can block/filter content from being uploaded on to the cloud
		- Using OCR (optical character recognition)
	- Google Workspace say for example
