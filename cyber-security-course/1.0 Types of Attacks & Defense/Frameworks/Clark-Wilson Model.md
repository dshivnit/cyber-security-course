Aims to achieve integrity by:
- Constrained Data Item (CDI)
	- Refers to the data type whose integrity we want to preserve
- Unconstrained Data Item (UDI)
	- Refers to all data types beyond CDI
		- Such as user and system input
- Transformation Procedures (TPs)
	- Programmed operations
		- Such as read and write
		- Should maintain the integrity of CDIs
- Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs)
	- Procedures check and ensure the validity of CDIs
