- Fundamental process that involves identifying, analysing, treating, monitoring, and reporting risks
	- To ensure that an org's objectives are achieved in a manner that is consistent with its risk appetite
- Identifying and addressing uncertainty is a huge part of decision making regardless of an org's size or vector

- Risk Identification
	- Recognising the potential risks that could negatively affect an org's ability to operate or achieve its objectives
	- A proactive process with a goal of creating a comprehensive list of risks based on those events that might prevent the org from achieving its objectives
- Risk Analysis
	- Involves identifying the likelihood and eventual impact of an identified risk
	- Qualitative
		- Categories and scales to rate risks
	- Quantitative
		- Using a numerical value
	- Outcome is to prioritise a list of risks based on their potential severity which can then be used to guide the risk treatment process
- Risk Treatment
	- Involves developing strategies to manage identified risks
	- Risk Avoidance
	- Risk Reduction
	- Risk Sharing
	- Risk Acceptance
	- Choice or strategy depends on the risk potentials impact and the org's risk tolerance
	- Goal:
		- To reduce the potential impact of risks to an acceptable level
- Risk Monitoring
	- Ongoing process of tracking identified risks
	- Monitoring residual risks
	- Identifying new risks
	- Reviewing the effectiveness of the risk process
	- Tracking
	- Monitoring
	- Identifying
	- Reviewing
	- This process is a crucial step because it ensures that the risk management process is dynamic and responsive to the changes in an org's internal, and external environments
- Risk Reporting
	- Involves communicating information about risks and the effectives of the risk management process to relevant stakeholders
	- Forms:
		- Dashboards
		- Heat Maps
		- Detailed Reports
- Sec+ Domains Covered
	- 5.2 - Explain elements of the risk management process

- Risk Assessment Frequency
	- Refers to how often the risk assessment process is conducted within an organisation
	- Can vary on the nature of the org and the type of risk involved
	- Types:
		- Ad-Hoc
		- Recurring
		- One-Time
		- Continuous
- Risk Identification
	- How a business will identify potential risks
	- How a business impact analysis must be performed
	- Concepts:
		- Recovery Time Objective
		- Recovery Point Objective
		- Mean Time to Repair
		- Mean Time Before Failure
- Qualitative Risk Analysis
	- Involves assessing risks and prioritising risks based on the likelihood of occurrence and potential impact, using descriptive or categorical scales
- Quantitative Risk Analysis
	- Involves numerically estimating the probability of each risk and its potential impact on project objectives
	- Using numerical data and statistical techniques to calculate these levels
- Risk Management Techniques
	- Risk Transfer
	- Risk Acceptance
	- Risk Avoidance
	- Risk Mitigation
- Risk Monitoring and Reporting

- Risk Assessment Frequency
	- The regularity with which risk assessments are conducted within an organisation
		- The nature of the organisations
		- The type of risks involved
		- And changes in the internal and external environments
	- Ad-hoc Risk Assessments
		- Specific events or situations and may be repeated
		- Conducted as and when needed, often in response to a specific event or situation that has the potential to introduce new risks or change the nature of existing risks
		- Example:
			- Running an ad-hoc risk assessment when launching a new product
			- Entering a new market
			- Responding to a significant event such as a natural disaster, or a major change in regulations
	- Recurring Risk Assessments
		- Conducted at regular intervals
			- Annually
			- Quarterly
			- Monthly
			- etc
		- Typically part of an orgs standard operating procedures
		- Example:
			- A financial institution may conduct a recurring risk assessment to monitor a credit risk, market risk and operational risk
			- Tech company might conduct recurring penetration testing where ethical hackers attempt to breach their systems to identify vulnerabilities
			- These assessments are scheduled regularly to ensure that any new vulns that may have emerged since the since the last assessment are identified and addressed
	- One-time Risk Assessment
		- Associated with a specific project or initiative and are not repeated
		- Conducted for a specific purpose and are not repeated
		- Often associated with a particular product or initiative
		- Example:
			- When implementing a new IT system
			- Undertaking a construction project
			- Organisational change
	- Continuous Risk Assessments
		- Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of risks
		- Example:
			- A cybersecurity team might use a continuous risk assessment to monitor threats and vulnerabilities enabling them to respond quickly to any potential issue
	- Risk assessment frequency varies based on the organisations needs and types of risks involved

- Risk Identification
	- Recognising potential risks that could negatively impact an organisations ability to operate or achieve its objectives
	- Essential to plan and prepare for potential disruptions
	- Once conducted, a Business Impact Analysis is usually conducted:
		- Identifying Key Metrics, like:
			- RTO - Recovery Time Objectives
			- RPO - Recovery Point Objective
			- MTTR - Mean Time To Repair
			- MTBF - Mean Time Between Failures
	- Proactive process that identifies potential threats, vulnerabilities that can affect overall company objectives
	- Techniques:
		- Brainstorming
		- Checklists
		- Interviews
		- Scenario Analysis
	- Goal - A comprehensive list of risks based on those events that might prevent the business from achieving objectives
	- The organisation should consider a wide range of risks, including, operational, financial, strategic, and reputational risks
		- Risks
			- Operational
			- Financial
			- Strategic
			- Reputational
	- Once potential risks have been identified, document and analyse them, based on their possible impact and probability
	- This will help the company prioritise their risk management effort and develop effective strategies to address these risks
	- Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
		- Process that involves evaluating the potential effects of disruption to an organisation's business functions and processes
	- Few terms:
		- RTO Recovery Time Objective
		- RPO Recovery Point Objective
		- MTTR Mean Time To Repair
		- MTBF Mean Time Between Failures
	- Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
		- Critical metric
		- It represents the maximum acceptable length of time that can elapse before the lack of a business function severely impacts the organisation
		- Target time in which a business process must be restored, after a disruption to avoid unacceptable consequences
		- Example:
			- Suppose an e-commerce website goes down due to a service failure
			- The company determines that it can tolerate a max of two hours of downtime before the impact of sales and customer satisfaction becomes severe
			- The Recovery Time Objective in this case, would be two hours
	- Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
		- Crucial metric
		- Represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time
		- The point in time in which  data must be restored to resume data operations
		- Example:
			- If a business has a Recovery Point Objective of four hours, it means the business can tolerate a data loss of up to four hours
			- If a financial institution that performs transactions continuously, determined that they can afford to lose a maximum of 15 minutes of transactional data in the event of a system failure. 
			- Their RPO is 15 minutes
	- Mean Time To Repair (Mean Time To Repair)
		- It represents the average time required to repair a failed component or system
		- Basic measure of the maintainability of repairable items
		- A lower mean time to repair is an indicator of a system that can be repaired quickly, minimising downtime and disruption
		- Example:
			- Machine manufacturing company
			- In the last year the machine has broken down five times
			- Each time it took an average of four hours to repair
			- In this case the MTTR is four hours
	- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
		- It represents the average time between failures
		- A higher mean time between failures indicates a system that fails less frequently
		- Example:
			- From the last example
			- Five times a year of breakdowns
			- A Mean Time Between Failures of 2.4 months or roughly 72 days
	- Risk identification is a critical first step in the risk management process

- Risk Register
	- Risk Management
		- Crucial for projects and businesses, involving the identification and assessment of uncertainties that may impact objectives
