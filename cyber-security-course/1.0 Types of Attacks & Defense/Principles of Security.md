Defense in Depth
- The use of multiple varied layers of security to an organisation's systems and data in the hopes that multiple layers will provide redundancy in an organisation's security perimeter 

- The CIA Triad
	- A security model that is used in consideration throughout creating a **security policy**
	- Been in use since 1998
	- Industry standard
	- Helps determine the value of data that it applies to, and in turn, the attention it needs from the business
	- A continuous cycle
	- The three elements can arguably overlap, if even just one element is not met, then the other two are rendered useless
	- If a security policy does not answer these three sections, then it is seldom an effective security policy

	- Confidentiality
		- The protection of data from unauthorised access and misuse
		- Protect data from parties that it is not intended for
	- Integrity
		- The condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorised changes are made
		- Integrity is maintained when the information remains unchanged during storage, transmission and usage not involving modification to the information 
		- Steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorised people
		- Access control and rigorous authentication can help prevent authorised users from making unauthorised changes. 
		- Hash verifications and digital signatures can help ensure that transactions are authentic and that files have not been modified or corrupted
	- Availability
		- In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user
		- Information and data should be available when authorised users need access to it
		- Often a key benchmark for an organisation
		- For example, having 99.99% of uptime on websites or systems (as laid out in SLAs (Service Level Agreements)). 
		- When a system is unavailable, it often results in damage to an organisations reputation and loss of finances
		- Achieved through a combination of elements, including
			- Reliable and well-tested hardware for IT servers (reputable servers)
			- Redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the primary
			- Implementing well-versed security protocols to protect technology and services from attack

- Principles of Privileges
	- Access given to entities are usually based upon two things:
		- The entity's role/function within the organisation
		- The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system
	- PIM
		- Privileged Identity Management
		- Used to translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system
	- PAM
		- Privileged Access Management
		- The management of the privileges a system's access role has (along with other things)
		- Contains enforcing security policies such as password management, auditing policies and reducing the attack surface a system faces
	- Principle of least privilege
		- Users should be given the minimum amount of privileges
		- And only granted those that are absolutely necessary for them to carry out their duties
		- Other people should be able to 'trust' what people write to 

- Security Models
	- Bell-La Padula Model
		- Used to achieve confidentiality
		- Has few assumptions
		- Organisations hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyone's responsibilities/roles are well-defined
		- Uses the rule, "No write down, no read up" 
		- Policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organisation hierarchies and vice versa
		- Simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful
		- Notes:
			- Even though a user may not have access to a file, they would however know about its existence - thus not really outlining confidentiality
			- Relies on a large amount of trust within the organisation
		- Popular with organisations such as the government and the military 
			- Due to members having gone a 'vetting' process
		- Applicants who are successfully vetted are 'assumed' to be trustworthy
	- Biba Model
		- No write up, no read down
			- Meaning that entities can create or write content to objects at or below their level but can only read the contents above the subjects level 
		- Addresses the CIA Triad
			- Confidentiality and Data Integrity 
		- Simple to implement
		- There will, however, be many levels of access and objects. Things can be overlooked when applying security controls
		- Often results in delays within a business, for example - a doctor would not be able to read the notes made by a nurse in a hospital with this model
		- Used in organisations or situations where integrity is more important than confidentiality
		- Example:
			- In software development, devs may only have access to the code that is necessary for them to do their job
			- They may not need access to critical pieces of information such as databases and so on

- Threat Modelling and Incident Response
	- Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving and testing the security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology infrastructure and services
	- Critical stage of the threat modelling process is identifying likely threats that an application or system may face, the vulnerabilities a system or application may be vulnerable to
	- Similar to risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers - the principles return to:
		- Preparation
		- Identification
		- Mitigations
		- Review
	- A complex process that needs constant review and discussion with a dedicated team. An effective threat model includes:
		- Threat Intelligence
		- Asset Identification
		- Mitigation Capabilities
		- Risk Assessment
	- To assist with this process of Threat Modelling - there are various frameworks that are available - such as:
		- STRIDE (authored by two MS security researchers - still very relevant today)
			- Spoofing Identity
				- Requires one to authenticate requests and users accessing a system
				- Involves a malicious party falsely identifying itself as another
				- Access keys (like API keys) or signatures via encryption helps remediate this threat
			- Tampering
				- Providing anti-tampering measures to a system or application, helps provide integrity to data
				- Data that is accessed must be kept integral and accurate
				- Example - a seal of freshness in a product signifying that the product hasn't been opened, or tampered with
			- Repudiation
				- Dictates the use of services such as logging activity for a system or application to track
			- Information disclosure
				- Applications or services that handle information of multiple users need to be appropriately configured to only show information relevant to the owner
			- Denial of service
				- Applications and services use up system resources, these two things should have measures in place so that abuse of the application/service won't result in bringing the whole system down
			- Elevation of privileges
				- This is the worst-case scenario for an application or service. It means that a user was able to escalate their authorisation to that of a higher level - like an administrator. 
				- This scenario often leads to further exploitation or information disclosure
		- PRIDE
			- Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis
	- A breach of security is known as an incident
	- Despite all rigorous threat models and secure system designs, incidents to happen
	- Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as Incident Response (IR) and are a whole career path in cybersecurity
	- Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact
	- Urgency will be determined by the type of attack faced, where the impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations
	- CSIRT Team (Computer Security Incident Response Team)
		- The team that responds to incidents
		- This team will have members that have technical knowledge about the systems and/or current incident
	- To successfully solve an incident, the following steps are often referred to as the six phases of Incident Response that take place
	- Steps to Incident Response:
		- Preparation
			- "Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?"
		- Identification
			- Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to? 
		- Containment
			- Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted? 
		- Eradication
			- Remove the active threat
		- Recovery
			- Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations
		- Lessons Learned
			- What can be learned from the incident?
			- If it was due to a phishing email, employees should be trained better to detect phishing emails
