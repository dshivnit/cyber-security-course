Confidentiality
- Ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data
- If a data breach results in the disclosure of PII (credit cards, personal information etc), the company will face massive losses - on multiple levels (reputation, financial, legal, and so on)
Integrity
- Aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; or, we have the ability to detect if any alteration has taken place to the data
Availability
- Aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed

Authenticity
- Ensuring that the document/file/data/thing is from the claimed source
Nonrepudiation
- Ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data/thing. 
- Indispensable for various domains - ie shopping, patient diagnosis, banking and so on

Parkerian Hexad
- Donn Parker, in 1988, proposed the Parkerian Hexad - six security elements:
	- Availability
	- Utility
	- Integrity
	- Authenticity
	- Confidentiality
	- Possession
- Utility
	- Focuses on the usefulness of the information
	- Of utility, of 'no' utility
		- If a laptop is encrypted and is locked and the user has forgotten the decryption key. The laptop is still there, the contents are still there - but it is rendered of 'no utility' ie useless because it is fully encrypted and we can't decrypt it. 
- Possession
	- Requires that we protect the information from unauthorised taking, copying, or controlling. 
	- If we lose possession of it, we lose possession to the information that was kept within (ie ransomware attacks - access to the needed data is no longer in our possession --- or if we lost a storage drive.. and so on)
-
