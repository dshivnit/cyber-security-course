- There will be a clash between
	- security
	- usability
- People want things to be easy, convenient
- People will try to deviate from common security practices for the sake of convenience

- Information Security
	- The data that the systems are holding
	- not the systems themselves
- Information Systems Security
	- Protecting the systems that hold and process the critical data
	- The actual hardware

- CIA Triad

	- Availability
		- Ensures that information and resources are accessible and functional when needed by authorised users

- Non-repudiation
	- A specific action or event has taken place and cannot be denied by the parties involved
		- ie if a sender sends an email and digitally signs it, then they can not deny sending it as their digital signature is attached to the email

- Non-Repudiation 
- Authentication

- AAA
	- Authentication
		- Verifying the identity of a user of a system

		- Natural disasters
		- Cyber-attacks
		- Data integrity breaches
		- Disclosure of confidential information
	- Vulnerabiltiies
		- Any weakness in the systems design or implementation
		- They come from internal factors
			- Software bugs
			- Improperly protected network devices
			- so on
		- Within the organisations control
			- Mitigating 
			- Transferring
			- or Accepting risks
	- Remember
		- Threat + no vulnerability
		- or Vulnerability + no threat
			- = no risk

- Confidentiality (ENCRYPTION!)
	- The protection of information from unauthorised individuals, entities or processes
	- Encryption
	- Protect personal privacy, business advantage, achieve regulatory compliance
	- PII
	- PHI
	- Various types of financial data
	- Encryption
	- Access Controls
	- Data Masking
		- Obscuring specific data within a database to make it inaccessible for unauthorised users while retaining the real data's authenticity for access by authorised users
	- Physical Security Measures
	- Training and Awareness

- Integrity (HASHING!)
	- Ensure information and data remain accurate and unchanged from their original state unless intentionally modified by an authorised individual
	- Hashing 
		- Hash digest
		- Digital fingerprint
	- Digital Signatures
		- Use encryption to both ensure integrity and authenticity

- Availability (REDUNDANCY!)
	- Used to ensure that information, systems and resources are accessible and operational when needed by authorised users
	- Three nines:
		- 99.9% uptime
		- 3.5 days of downtime per year..
	- Five nines:
		- 99.999% ! Gold standard
		- 5.26 minutes of downtime per year......
	- Ensuring Business Continuity
		- Every minute of downtime can cost a business/client substantial amounts of money, or consider a hospital - this would relate to lives being lost
	- Maintaining Customer Trust
		- Downtimes can also lead to lowered trust levels from customers
	- Upholding an Organisation's Reputation
		- Company reputation can be tarnished if there are continuous or repeated downtimes
	- Using redundancy in designs is beneficial to ensure availability
		- Server redundancy
			- Using multiple servers in a load balance so that if one is overloaded or fails, the other servers can take over the load to continue supporting end users
		- Data 
			- Involves storing data in multiple places
			- Locally using RAIDs
			- or a hybrid of cloud-based and on-prem systems
		- Network
			- If one network path fails, then there is an alternative route for the network connection to take
			- Say for example a mobile 4G/5G backup 
		- Power
			- UPS
			- Generators
			- A power back up essentially that kicks in when the power goes out

- Non-repudiation (DIGITAL SIGNATURES!)
	-  A beacon for authenticity, accountability and assurance.
	- Focused on providing undeniable proof in digital transactions
	- Digital Signatures
	- Digital Certificates
	- A signed receipt upon delivery
	- A signed seal upon transmission
	- Consider a royal seal upon a scroll or envelope (a signet ring)
		- That was some time ago :) 
		- But that's non-repudiation right there
	- Digital Signature
		- Created first by hashing a particular message or communication to be digitally signed and encrypting the hash digest with the user's private key using asymmetric encryption
		- Used to confirm the authenticity of digital transactions
		- Ensuring integrity 
		- Providing accountability

			- Secret work, phrase, password (uname pword)
		- Something you have
			- Possession factor
			- A fob key for example
			- A smartphone
		- Something you are 
			- Inherence factor
			- A unique physical or behavioural characteristic
			- Facial recognition 
			- Fingerprint scan etc

		- ie a firewall
	- Deterrent Controls
		- Aimed to discourage potential attackers by making the effort seem less appealing or more challenging
		- ie an alarm system
		- or signage
	- Detective Controls
		- Monitor and alert organisations to illegal activity before or as they occur
		- IDS - Intrusion Detection System
	- Corrective Controls
		- To mitigate any potential damage and to return the system to their normal state
		- ie when malware is quarantined
			- Goes from detective to corrective control measures
	- Compensating Controls
		- Alternate measures that are implemented when primary security controls are not feasible or effective
			- ie a legacy system that can't support the latest form of encryption - so using an older encryption but then running it through a secure tunnel 
	- Directive Controls
		- Rooted in policy or documentation and set the standards for behaviour within an organisation

- Gap Analysis
	- A process of evaluating the differences between an organisations current performance and its desired performance
	- Conducting a gap analysis can be valuable in determining an organisations overall cyber security posture
	- Define the scope of the analysis
	- Gather data on the current state of the organisation
	- Analyse the findings of the data collected to identify gaps of current to desired states
	- Develop a plan to bridge those gaps
		- A timeline to achieve required/desired goals
		- ie going from on-prem to cloud solutions
			- Determine the security risks involved in the migration
			- To ensure a secure and smooth transition, a comprehensive gap analysis may be considered
				- By evaluating the on-prem security measures (firewalls, IDSs, and data access controls)
					- Essentially documenting the current state
				- Then compare it to the desired security standard to the chosen cloud provider
					- Perhaps the current states aren't to standard to that of the cloud providers
				- Analyse the gap and see what can be changed
				- Make the necessary modifications
	- Technical Gap Analysis
		- Evaluating the current technical infrastructure 
		- Identifying any areas where it will fall short to desired standards
		- ie the current network infrastructure may not be fast enough or current security protocols aren't robust enough to protect the company's data being stored at rest in a cloud-based solution
		- Address those issues
	- Business Gap Analysis
		- Evaluating an organisations current business processes and identifying areas where they fall short of the capabilities required to fully utilise cloud-based solutions
	- POA&M
		- Plan Of Action and Milestones
		- Outlines specific measures to address each vulnerabilty
		- Allocate resources
		- Set up timelines for each remediation task that is needed

		Regardless of its origin (internal, or external)
	- Control Plane
		- Lays out the policies and procedures
		- Overarching framework and set of components responsible for defining, managing, and enforcing the policies related to user and system access within an organisation

				- Policy Engine and the Policy Administrator
				- Policy Engine
					- Like a rulebook
					- Policy engine will cross-reference access requests with its predefined policies
				- Policy Administrator
					- Used to establish and manage the accessed policies
			- Subject/System
				- The individual or entity that is attempting or requesting access
				- (human and can be non-human)
			- Policy Enforcement Point
				- The final step
				- When the decision to grant or deny access to requested resources is made
	- Data Plane
		- Ensures that those policies are properly executed
